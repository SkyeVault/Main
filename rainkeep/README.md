# Rainkeep — Arynwood Terminal

**Rainkeep** is the codebase for [Arynwood.com](https://arynwood.com), a hand-coded terminal-inspired website documenting the creation of decentralized tools, blockchain infrastructure, and open-source digital craftsmanship.

Arynwood is the public-facing interface of a larger creative and technical endeavor — blending development, storytelling, and system-building into a transparent workflow anyone can follow.

## Structure

The `rainkeep` folder contains:

- `static/blog-html/` – Terminal-styled HTML blog posts (DevLog format)  
- `src/pages/blog/index.astro` – Auto-generated blog index listing all logs  
- `styles/` – Minimal CSS and typography tailored to terminal aesthetics  
- `README.md` – This file  

The site is served via GitHub Pages and optionally mirrored to IPFS for decentralized access.
