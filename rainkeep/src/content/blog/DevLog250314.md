# Devlog 250314

## **Focus for the Day**

Today, my primary goal is to **sort out my crypto woes** and resolve the issues with acquiring **testnet funds**. Once I have the necessary **MATIC or POL on the Polygon Amoy testnet**, I’ll be able to move past this bottleneck and **jump back into smart contract development**.

## **Immediate Priorities**

1. **Investigate missing MATIC purchase** – Double-check whether the funds from MetaMask's Coinbase integration ever arrived.
2. **Explore alternative testnet funding methods** – If necessary, consider:
   - Trying different **Amoy faucets** or community grant programs.
   - Checking if anyone in the dev community can send a small amount of **testnet POL**.
   - Looking into bridge alternatives to move funds from **Ethereum or another chain**.
3. **Ensure I have enough gas fees to move WETH** – If successful, swap just enough MATIC for transactions and continue testing smart contracts.
4. **Resume smart contract development** – As soon as I have functional funds on **Polygon Amoy**, I’ll refocus on:
   - Deploying and testing **MetaverseLand.sol** and **Marketplace.sol**.
   - Running on-chain simulations using **REVM**.
   - Expanding contract features, such as land leasing and auction mechanics.

## **Reflection**

The dependency on **gas fees to move funds** has been the biggest roadblock so far. This process highlights a significant usability issue in blockchain development—having tokens without the ability to move them due to gas constraints creates a frustrating loop.

That said, once I get past this, it should be a straight path back into **contract deployment and metaverse development**. The goal is to ensure I don’t lose momentum by getting stuck in funding logistics.

## **Next Steps**

- **Check for missing transactions** and determine if I need to escalate with Coinbase support.
- **Test new funding approaches** to secure enough testnet MATIC or POL to proceed.
- **Resume smart contract deployment** and get back to core development work.

Hoping that by the end of the day, I’ll have this sorted and be ready to move forward!
