# Devlog 250324: Breaking Through the Testnet Barrier

## **Summary**

Today marked a breakthrough in my development workflow. After hitting roadblocks trying to acquire testnet funds, I was finally able to secure **100 Amoy POL tokens** for the **Polygon Amoy testnet**. This clears the way for **active contract testing, gas fee benchmarking, and simulation of full deployment workflows** within my metaverse sandbox environment.

---

## **Problem**

Getting testnet POL tokens on Amoy had been a frustrating and limiting experience:

- The public faucets (e.g., Alchemy’s, QuickNode’s) refused to send tokens unless my wallet already held **mainnet POL**.
- Bridging or swapping from other assets was impossible without **gas funds**.
- This circular dependency stalled progress and made it impossible to test contracts in a meaningful way.

---

## **Solution**

After running into repeated issues, I submitted a request directly via the official **Polygon developer faucet form** at:

> [https://faucet.polygon.technology](https://faucet.polygon.technology)

### What I Did:
- Filled out the **developer use-case form**, describing my metaverse project and need for smart contract testing.
- Within a short time, I received an **email confirmation** from the Polygon team.
- They **manually approved** my wallet and **sent 100 AMOY POL tokens** for development.

---

## **Impact**

With the testnet funds finally in place, I can now:

- **Deploy and test smart contracts** (minting NFTs, marketplace logic, etc.)
- **Measure gas usage** and optimize contract functions
- **Simulate full user flows** (wallet auth, transactions, land purchases)
- **Experiment with REVM + Foundry tooling** to simulate contracts both off-chain and on-chain

This unblocks a major development milestone and allows me to prepare my project for eventual **mainnet deployment**.

---

## **Next Steps**

- Run end-to-end contract tests on Amoy with **real wallet and gas simulations**
- Finalize **ERC-721 minting and transfer logic**
- Set up **deployment scripts** and verify contract addresses
- Test UI wallet interactions in the **Polygon L2 context**
- Begin preparing the **mainnet deployment plan** for MetaverseLand and related contracts

---

## **Reflection**

The experience highlighted the importance of developer-friendly testnet access. Without it, even well-prepared developers can find themselves stuck in gas fee loops. Today reminded me that **resourcefulness, persistence, and direct outreach can still solve problems**, even in the Web3 world.

Moving forward, I feel a new sense of momentum. The sandbox is open. Now it’s time to build.
