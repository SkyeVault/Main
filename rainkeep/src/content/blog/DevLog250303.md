### *Rust, APIs, and the Joy of Debugging*  

---

## **Tasks Completed**  

### **1. Terminal & Zsh Workflow Enhancements**  
- **Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k:** Customized prompt for clarity and efficiency.  
- **Plugins Installed & Configured:**  
  - `zsh-syntax-highlighting` for improved readability.  
  - `zsh-autosuggestions` for command predictions.  
  - `fzf` for fuzzy searching through files and history.  
  - `autojump` for quick directory navigation.  
- **Optimized Command History:**  
  - Re-mapped `CTRL + R` to search history **without requiring fzf.**  
  - Ensured frequently used commands are surfaced quickly.  
- **Homebrew & Performance Fixes:**  
  - Homebrew is installed at `/usr/local/bin/brew` instead of `/opt/homebrew`.  
  - Identified that Homebrew is slow on macOS 12 but manageable with direct installs.  

### **2. Rust Installation & First Project Setup**  
- Installed **Rust via rustup**, ensuring the correct environment variables were loaded.  
- Verified installation with:  
  ```sh
  rustc --version  
  cargo --version  
  ```
- Created a new Rust project:  
  ```sh
  cargo new skyevault-spotify
  ```
- Explored Rust's package management:  
  ```sh
  cargo add reqwest serde_json tokio
  ```
  *(Adding dependencies efficiently instead of manually updating `Cargo.toml`.)*

### **3. Spotify Playlist Generator - API Integration & Debugging**  
- **Authentication Setup:**  
  - Implemented OAuth2 authentication for Spotify.  
  - Generated access token, set up auto-refresh to handle expiration.  
- **Rust Dependencies Used:**  
  - `reqwest` for making API requests.  
  - `serde_json` for parsing Spotify’s JSON responses.  
- **Troubleshooting & Fixes:**  
  - Encountered `reqwest` SSL certificate issues—fixed by ensuring `native-tls` was enabled.  
  - JSON parsing errors due to mismatched struct types—resolved by refining `serde_json` struct definitions.  
  - API request initially returned empty data—fixed by adjusting query parameters to ensure valid results.  
- **Successes:**  
  - Successfully authenticated with Spotify API.  
  - Retrieved playlist data—next step is refining how results are displayed.  
- **Current Issue:**  
  - Final API response is throwing an unexpected error. It seems to be related to how the data is structured before rendering. Debugging continues.

## **Quick Tip: Avoiding Full Recompiles for Faster Rust Updates**  
During testing, we noticed that **running `cargo run` every time to test code changes was painfully slow** because it was re-compiling everything from scratch. The workaround? **Use Rust’s built-in incremental compilation features!**  

### **What was happening?**  
By default, Rust compiles the **entire project** before running, which is great for performance but frustrating during active debugging. The process slowed us down, especially with API calls requiring multiple iterations to troubleshoot errors.  

### **The Fix: Use `cargo check` & `cargo watch`**  
Instead of running `cargo run` for every test, we switched to:  

#### **1. `cargo check` – Fast Compilation Without Running**  
```sh
cargo check
```
- Quickly verifies that the code compiles **without fully building and running the executable**.  
- Perfect for catching syntax errors **without waiting for a full recompile**.  

#### **2. `cargo watch` – Auto-Recompilation on File Save**  
```sh
cargo install cargo-watch  # One-time setup
cargo watch -x run
```
- Watches files for changes and **automatically recompiles + runs** when a file is modified.  
- Saves time by eliminating the need to manually re-run `cargo run` each time.  

### **Outcome:**  
Switching to `cargo check` and `cargo watch` **significantly reduced debugging time**, making iteration smoother while working through Spotify API issues.

## **Git Journal Entry - March 3, 2025**  

### **Commit Message:**  
```
"Optimized Zsh setup, installed Rust, and built first API connection for the Spotify playlist generator. Fixed incremental compilation issues."
```

### **Detailed Log:**  
Today, I **streamlined my terminal workflow**, ensuring Zsh is set up for peak efficiency. This included improving history search, adding plugins for quick navigation, and optimizing command completion. These small changes make a big difference in workflow speed.  

On the development side, **Rust is fully installed and configured**, and I started my first Rust-based API project: a **Spotify playlist generator.** The main challenge was **handling authentication and structuring API requests in Rust**, but I got it working after some deep dives into `reqwest` and `serde_json`.  

During debugging, I realized Rust’s full recompilation process was slowing things down. Implementing **`cargo check` for faster error-checking** and **`cargo watch -x run` for automatic recompilation** made a huge difference in workflow speed.  

**Troubleshooting highlights:**  
- Adjusted Rust structs to properly handle JSON responses.  
- Resolved SSL issues in `reqwest`.  
- Fixed empty API responses by refining request parameters.  
- Improved debugging efficiency by reducing unnecessary full rebuilds.  

**Current Roadblock:**  
- **Final API response handling is throwing errors.**  
- Still working on refining how the data is structured before rendering.  

Overall, **a solid foundation is now in place** for both Rust development and DevOps workflow.

## **Next Steps for Tomorrow:**  
- **Spotify Project:** Debug API response issue and refine output structure.  
- **Rust Learning:** Explore better error handling strategies and async programming for API requests.  
- **Git & DevOps Documentation:** Start drafting SkyeVault Ops README for project transparency.

## **Final Thoughts:**  
Rust is proving to be a powerful but meticulous language. **Learning how to streamline debugging and reduce compilation time** made a huge difference today. The **Spotify API project is taking shape**, and even though there’s still an error in the final response parsing, the overall progress has been solid. Excited to solve the last issue and move forward with cleaner, more efficient Rust workflows!
