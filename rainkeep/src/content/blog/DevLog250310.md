Dev Log 250310 - End of Day Update

Today’s focus was on blockchain development, and all planned goals were successfully completed. The structure is coming together as expected, and progress is aligning well with both weekly and daily goals.

Also took a moment to appreciate the first day of spring, a quiet reminder that the seasons continue on their own steady path. A good balance of productivity and presence today.

Tomorrow’s focus will build on this momentum.
