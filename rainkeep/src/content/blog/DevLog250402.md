# DevLog 250402 — Debugging Slugs in Astro

Today I’m juggling a teething baby and some buggy dynamic routing in my Astro blog — and somehow I’m still optimistic.

---

## Current Status

- **Astro + Netlify setup is live and clean**  
  [www.arynwood.com/blog](https://www.arynwood.com/blog) is now the central hub for my devlogs and development journey.

- **Issue:**  
  The dynamic `[slug].astro` file is creating dead links to blog posts.  
  It’s likely a frontmatter or file path issue, possibly tied to improper use of `getStaticPaths()` or Markdown metadata inconsistencies.

- **Plan:**  
  Carve out 15 minutes this afternoon to troubleshoot and fix the routing syntax.  
  First check: Are all `slug` values in `getStaticPaths()` matching the actual post paths?

## Why I Love Astro

Even with the hiccups, Astro is a solid choice for my blog and future Web3 content. Here’s why:

### **Key Features of Astro**
- **Partial Hydration:** Only JavaScript where needed — fast by default.
- **Markdown + MDX Support:** Perfect for writing developer-focused content.
- **Built-in Routing:** File-based routing that’s intuitive (when the syntax behaves).
- **Framework Agnostic:** Can use React, Svelte, Vue, or just plain HTML.
- **Zero JavaScript by default:** Lightweight builds and excellent Core Web Vitals.
- **Excellent for Static Sites:** Great choice for a performance-focused devlog.
- **TailwindCSS Support:** Seamless styling without the boilerplate.
- **Open-Source & Actively Maintained:** Built by a community I respect.

## Next Up

Once the slug issue is fixed:
- Add devlog navigation
- Connect ENS or `.nft` domain logic
- Plan a minimal 3D component for the homepage  
- Resume work on my **Metaverse Sandbox** and IPFS asset viewer

That’s the plan — as long as the baby nap gods are kind.
