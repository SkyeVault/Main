# **Dev Log | 250307**  
### *Publishing the Spotify Playlist Maker & Streamlining Repository Management*  

---

## **Overview**  
Instead of separating projects into different repositories, I decided to **package and publish** the **Spotify Playlist Maker** on crates.io. This allows for better version control, easier installation, and a cleaner development workflow while keeping everything in one place.  

With this, the project is now in a **fully functional and published state**, making it accessible for others to install and use.  

---

## **1. Publishing the Spotify Playlist Maker Package**  

### **Goal:** Make the project easily installable via Cargo.  
- Successfully **published the package on crates.io**.  
- Verified installation with:  
  ```sh
  cargo install spotify_playlist_maker  
  ```  
- Confirmed that dependencies and build processes work correctly.  

---

## **2. Refining Documentation & CI/CD Workflow**  

### **Goal:** Improve clarity and maintainability.  
- Updated `README.md` to include:  
  - Installation instructions.  
  - Improved formatting for better readability.  
- Verified that **GitHub Actions CI workflow** correctly targets the `spotify_playlist_maker` directory.  
- Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub, ensuring everything is up to date.

## **3. Next Steps**  

### **Documentation Enhancements**  
- Add more **usage examples** to improve user experience.  
- Expand README to include **troubleshooting tips and advanced features**.  

### **Feature Improvements**

## **Final Thoughts**  
Publishing the **Spotify Playlist Maker** as a package is a major step forward. The next focus is on **improving usability and automation** to make future updates more efficient. Keeping everything in a **single repository** simplifies project management while ensuring that new features and enhancements are easier to track and maintain.  

Now that the package is live, the next goal is to **expand functionality and streamline updates** for future versions.
