# **Dev Log | 250309**  
### *Debugging Package Failure & Refining Blockchain Project*  

---

## **Overview**  
Today's focus is on **fixing the failing status** in the current package due to the **lib update** and continuing to clean up and refine the **NanoVault project**. Additionally, I’ll be reviewing the **pathway script** and considering a **new project name**, since "NanoVault" is already used by a **Nano blockchain tool**.  

---

## **1. Debugging Package Failure**  

### **Issue:**  
- The package **status is failing** due to the **lib update**.  
- The issue likely stems from **incorrect module structure or missing references**.  
- Plan to **rework the library structure** and check the integration with `docs.rs`.  

### **Next Steps:**  
- **Run `cargo check` and `cargo test`** to pinpoint errors.  
- **Ensure `lib.rs` is correctly structured** and module paths are defined properly.  
- **Update `Cargo.toml` if needed** to reflect the correct library exports.  
- **Push fixes** and verify the package builds successfully.  

---

## **2. NanoVault Project Cleanup**  

### **Tasks Completed:**  
- Cleaned up the **NanoVault project directory** for better organization.  
- Removed unnecessary files and refactored initial scripts.  

### **Pathway Script Review:**  
- Reviewing the **setup and environment configuration** in the **pathway script**.  
- Ensuring smooth installation and setup across different environments.  

### **New Project Name Consideration:**  
- "NanoVault" is already taken by a **Nano blockchain security tool**.  
- Researching **alternative names** that align with the project’s security and blockchain focus.  

---

## **3. Next Steps**  

### **Immediate Focus:**  
- Debug and fix the **failing package status** related to `lib.rs`.  
- Finalize **NanoVault project name change** to avoid conflicts.  
- Refine the **pathway script** to ensure smooth execution.  

### **Future Considerations:**  
- Expand package documentation with **usage examples and API references**.  
- Plan out additional **blockchain security integrations** for the project.  
- Continue structuring projects for **scalability and maintainability**.  

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
The **lib update issue** needs to be resolved to get the package back to a **passing status**. At the same time, **cleaning up the NanoVault project** and selecting a **new name** will help with long-term clarity. Once these are sorted, the focus will shift toward **refining the setup process and expanding project functionality**.  

Will update once debugging progress is made.

### *Fixing Rust Formatting, Publishing Issues, and Syncing Git*  

---

## **Issue Summary**  
During the update to **version 0.1.5** of `spotify_playlist_maker`, several issues surfaced:  
1. **Cargo Formatting Issues** – `cargo fmt --check` failed due to incorrect import formatting.  
2. **Zsh Parse Error** – Rust code was mistakenly executed in the terminal instead of being compiled.  
3. **Duplicate Imports** – `main.rs` contained redundant imports, causing compilation errors.  
4. **Git Sync Issues** – Uncommitted changes needed to be cleaned up and pushed.  
5. **Publishing Errors** – Required a version bump and authentication before publishing.  

---

## **1. Fixing Formatting Errors (`cargo fmt --check`)**  

Rust’s formatter (`cargo fmt --check`) failed due to misaligned imports. The fix:  
```bash
cargo fmt
```
This auto-corrected the formatting. To verify:  
```bash
cargo fmt --check
```

### **Manual Fix (If Needed)**  
Adjusted `main.rs` to ensure proper import ordering:  
```rust
use rspotify::{
    clients::{BaseClient, OAuthClient},
    model::{PlayableId, SearchResult, SearchType},
    AuthCodeSpotify, Credentials, OAuth,
};
use spotify_playlist_maker::{format_track_name, generate_spotify_auth_url};
use std::{collections::HashSet, env, error::Error};
use tiny_http::Server;
```

---

## **2. Fixing Git Sync Issues**  

Before publishing, committed and pushed the latest changes:  
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed formatting and prepared for release"
git push origin main
```
If Git rejected the push due to out-of-sync branches, a rebase was performed:  
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

---

## **3. Publishing Version 0.1.5**  

Updated `Cargo.toml` to reflect the new version:  
```toml
version = "0.1.5"
```
Committed and pushed the update:  
```bash
git add Cargo.toml
git commit -m "Bumped version to 0.1.5"
git push origin main
```
Verified package integrity before publishing:  
```bash
cargo package
```
Published the package to Crates.io:  
```bash
cargo publish
```
After a successful upload, verified the release on [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/spotify_playlist_maker).  

---

## **4. Final Outcome**  

**GitHub Actions Passed** – No more formatting or linting errors.  
 **Docs.rs Passed** – Documentation successfully generated.  
 **Version 0.1.5 Published** – Available on Crates.io.  

This update ensures `spotify_playlist_maker` is **correctly formatted, structured, and published** without issues.
