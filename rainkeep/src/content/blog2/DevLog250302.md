DevLog 250302: The Shift to Rust and Transparent DevOps

Where We’ve Been

SkyeVault Ops began as an experiment in AWS security and automation, with a focus on understanding cloud security best practices and improving workflows through automation. The initial work involved scripting and infrastructure setup, but it became clear that existing approaches were limiting scalability, security, and maintainability.

Early efforts were focused on:
	•	Setting up AWS security monitoring tools
	•	Automating infrastructure with simple scripts
	•	Exploring cloud security principles through hands-on projects

While these efforts provided a solid foundation, they exposed fundamental inefficiencies in traditional DevOps approaches. Scripting languages like Python and Bash, while useful, lacked the performance, memory safety, and reliability needed for long-term scaling.

This realization led to a decision: SkyeVault Ops needed to evolve.

Where We’re Going

The next phase of SkyeVault Ops is a full transition to Rust-based DevOps and security automation. This shift is not just about changing a programming language—it’s about adopting a new way of thinking about security, performance, and transparency in development.

The key areas of focus moving forward:

1. Rust as the Core of SkyeVault Ops

Rust provides:
	•	Memory safety without garbage collection, reducing security risks.
	•	Concurrency without data races, making automation tools more efficient.
	•	Performance at the level of C/C++, ensuring that cloud security tools run efficiently.

Instead of relying on traditional scripting, SkyeVault Ops will be built as a modular, high-performance security automation framework.

2. Fully Transparent DevOps

This project will document everything, from design decisions to technical challenges. Transparency will be achieved through:
	•	Detailed DevLogs outlining progress, roadblocks, and solutions.
	•	Clear CI/CD workflows that automate testing, deployments, and security checks.
	•	Publicly available tools and resources that contribute to open-source security.

3. GitLab as a Potential Home for SkyeVault Ops

While GitHub has been the primary platform, GitLab offers advantages for security-focused DevOps workflows. This transition will involve:
	•	Evaluating GitLab CI/CD as an alternative to GitHub Actions.
	•	Exploring self-hosting options for full control over infrastructure.
	•	Comparing feature sets to determine if GitLab is the right fit for the project.

If GitLab proves to be the better choice, SkyeVault Ops will fully migrate. If not, the project will remain on GitHub with select integrations from GitLab where needed.

Next Steps

The immediate focus is on:
	1.	Refactoring initial scripts into Rust for better performance and reliability.
	2.	Setting up a CI/CD pipeline that supports Rust development and automated security testing.
	3.	Publishing the first Rust-based security tool as part of the SkyeVault Ops framework.

This transition marks a new direction—one that aligns with modern security engineering, automation best practices, and DevOps transparency.

Future updates will go deeper into technical implementations, challenges, and breakthroughs.

This is just the beginning.
