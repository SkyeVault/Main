# DevLog 250329 – Exploring 3D Environments for the Metaverse Sandbox

**Date:** 2025-03-29
**Focus:** Research and comparison of different 3D frameworks and environments for building the front-end of my decentralized metaverse project.

---

## Objective

The goal today was to gain clarity on the **best 3D environment to use** for the **Metaverse Sandbox** project. I want a framework that is:

- Open-source and free to use
- Compatible with Web3 integrations (wallets, NFT rendering)
- Lightweight enough for browser performance
- Flexible enough for future expansion (VR support, avatars, multiplayer)

---

## 3D Environment Candidates

### **1. Three.js**

- **Type:** WebGL framework  
- **Pros:**
  - Extremely popular and well-documented
  - Full control over rendering and interaction
  - Works well with NFT metadata and IPFS-hosted textures
  - Can integrate with wallet libraries (ethers.js, wagmi)
- **Cons:**
  - Steeper learning curve
  - Requires building your own world logic and UI from scratch

### **2. A-Frame**

- **Type:** Declarative 3D framework built on top of Three.js  
- **Pros:**
  - HTML-like syntax (easier to prototype)
  - Supports WebXR and VR out of the box
  - Large community for learning
  - Can be used to create spatial galleries quickly
- **Cons:**
  - Limited low-level control compared to pure Three.js
  - Can become complex when adding custom shaders or logic

### **3. Babylon.js**

- **Type:** WebGL engine with built-in physics, materials, animation  
- **Pros:**
  - High-performance rendering engine
  - Good tooling (sandbox editor, Node Material Editor)
  - Built-in avatar system and multiplayer capabilities
- **Cons:**
  - Heavier than Three.js
  - May require more optimization for slower devices

### **4. Unity + WebGL Export**

- **Type:** Game engine with Web3 plugins  
- **Pros:**
  - Rich toolset, built-in physics, lighting, animations
  - Many tutorials and Web3 plugins available
- **Cons:**
  - Exported WebGL builds are large and slow to load
  - Not truly open-source
  - Requires more tooling and setup
  - Not ideal for low-bandwidth or mobile access

## Additional Considerations

| Feature                  | Three.js     | A-Frame     | Babylon.js | Unity |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Open Source              | Yes          | Yes         | Yes        | No    |
| IPFS/NFT Integration     | Manual setup | Yes         | Yes        | Partial (with plugins) |
| VR/AR Support            | With WebXR   | Built-in    | Yes        | Yes   |
| Performance              | Lightweight  | Medium      | Heavier    | Heavy |
| Customization            | High         | Medium      | High       | Very High |
| Web3 Wallet Integration  | Manual       | Manual      | Manual     | Plugin-dependent |
| Browser Compatibility    | Excellent    | Excellent   | Excellent  | Limited (heavy load) |

---

## Takeaway

Right now, **Three.js** still looks like the best balance of:

- **Customizability**
- **Performance**
- **Web3 friendliness**

If I can scaffold out the scene using Three.js and start simple (NFT image frames on walls, land ownership overlays), it can grow into a deeper space later with avatars and multiplayer support.

I may still prototype a quick layout in **A-Frame** just to explore ease of use, but the long-term architecture will likely live in a **React + Three.js** environment for maximum control.

---

## Next Steps

- Set up a minimal Three.js scene with imported IPFS images from my NFT collection  
- Integrate Web3 wallet connection (MetaMask)  
- Display owned land vs. unowned tiles in a basic 3D grid  
- Log findings in the sandbox GitHub repo with screenshots and benchmarks

**Summary:**  
Today’s research helped clarify the **technical direction for the 3D layer** of the Metaverse Sandbox. Next session will begin actual implementation inside the `frontend/` folder.
