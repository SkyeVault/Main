# DevLog 250407 — Finally Debugged Astro Blog

Today’s log is dedicated to cleaning up and debugging my Astro-based blog system.  
After a week of Markdown rendering bugs and deployment issues, I now have a streamlined, phone-friendly system that works consistently.

---

## Problems Solved

- Astro markdown rendering failed due to import + routing errors
- `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` was not resolving `.md` files
- Netlify builds broke from missing `public/blog-html` folder
- Pandoc templates were too heavy for mobile workflows
- Blog index lacked sorting, consistency, and polish
- Markdown devlogs weren’t triggering site updates

---

## Fixes & Solutions

### Folder System

- All `.md` files converted to `.html` using Pandoc
- Output moved to: `rainkeep/public/blog-html/`
- Fallback uses static `.html` instead of dynamic Markdown

### Markdown → HTML Script

File: `convert_blog_md.sh`

- Converts `.md` logs from `rainkeep/src/content/blog2/`
- Applies custom Pandoc template
- Copies output into `public/blog-html/` for build

### Custom Pandoc Template

File: `plain-template.html`

- Minimal terminal-inspired HTML
- Lavender CSS accents, optimized for mobile readability

### GitHub Action

Workflow: `.github/workflows/build-devlogs.yml`

- Triggers on `.md` push
- Installs Pandoc
- Converts logs to `.html`
- Pushes to `public/blog-html/` for Netlify to render

---

## Terminal UI Polishing

File: `index.astro`

- Hardcoded list of `.html` logs, sorted by date
- Styled with lavender terminal aesthetic
- Responsive layout, hover effects, clear spacing

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Auto-generate post list from `public/blog-html/`
- [ ] Add post excerpts from frontmatter
- [ ] Create iOS Shortcut or GitHub CLI to push from phone
- [ ] Build `/lorelogs` terminal home with ASCII nav and category filter
