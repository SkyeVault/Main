# **Journal Entry: 250313 - Web3 Decentralized Metaverse Sandbox**

## **Project: Web3 Decentralized Metaverse Sandbox**

### **Objective**
I am building a full-stack **Web3 decentralized metaverse sandbox**, where users can experience an **NFT gallery for socializing**, buy **virtual land**, and build **custom business spaces**. This project aims to create a **decentralized, user-owned environment** that integrates blockchain, NFT-based land ownership, and immersive 3D interactions.

### **Current Focus**
I am researching the **best way to derive a tech stack** for this project. My focus is on selecting frameworks, blockchain layers, and infrastructure that will allow for **scalability, low-cost transactions, and decentralized hosting**. This research will guide the next steps in development.

### **Core Features to Implement**
1. **NFT Gallery Experience** – Users can visit, explore, and interact with NFTs in a virtual space.
2. **Tokenized Land Ownership** – Virtual land will be represented as NFTs that can be bought, sold, or leased.
3. **Business Space Customization** – Users can build digital shops, studios, and offices.
4. **Web3 Wallet Authentication** – MetaMask and WalletConnect for seamless login.
5. **Decentralized Storage** – Using IPFS or Arweave for NFT assets and metadata.
6. **Social Interactions** – Voice, chat, and live events.

### **Tech Stack Considerations**
#### **Frontend (3D Interface & User Interaction)**
- **Three.js** or **Babylon.js** for browser-based 3D rendering.
- **WebXR** for potential VR expansion.
- **React.js** or **Next.js** for UI components.

#### **Smart Contracts & Blockchain Integration**
- **Ethereum (Layer 2 - Polygon or Arbitrum)** for low-cost transactions.
- **ERC-721/ERC-1155** for NFT-based land and assets.
- **OpenZeppelin Libraries** for contract security.

#### **Backend & Storage**
- **Node.js + Express** or **Rust-based backend** for Web3 interactions.
- **IPFS/Arweave** for decentralized storage.
- **GraphQL or The Graph** for querying blockchain data.

#### **Social & Communication**
- **WebRTC** for voice and video chat.
- **Livepeer** for decentralized streaming.
- **GPT-4 AI NPCs** for interactive experiences.

### **Next Steps**
- Finalize the **core tech stack** based on feasibility and scalability.
- Research **smart contract security best practices** to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Experiment with **Three.js and Web3 wallet integration** for initial prototype.
- Investigate **decentralized hosting options** to avoid reliance on Web2 infrastructure.

### **Challenges to Solve**
- Choosing a blockchain that balances **low fees and decentralization**.
- Ensuring **fast load times and smooth 3D rendering** in browsers.
- Making **NFT land interactions gas-efficient and user-friendly**.

### **Developer Notes**
This log serves as a **technical roadmap** for the project's initial research phase. The next few weeks will be dedicated to **tech stack finalization, contract design, and 3D rendering tests**. More detailed development logs will follow as components come together.

# **Devlog 250313: Alchemy Setup and Polygon Amoy Testnet Challenges**  

## **What Happened**  

- **Alchemy setup was successful.** Connected to the **Polygon Amoy testnet**, verified **RPC settings**, and confirmed everything was working.  
- **Hit the "must have 0.001 POL on Polygon PoS" issue.** The **Amoy faucet** refused to send testnet POL unless the account already held **mainnet POL**, leading to the next challenge.  
- **Tried bridging funds.** Sent **WETH from Coinbase Wallet**, expecting a simple transfer to **MetaMask**, but it turned into a **gas-fee nightmare**.  
- **No way to move WETH without MATIC.** Couldn’t send or swap anything because there wasn’t enough **MATIC to cover gas fees**.  
- **Bought MATIC through MetaMask (via Coinbase Pay).** Expected an **instant transfer**, but it **never appeared** in **MetaMask or Polygonscan**, leading to another dead end.  

---

## **Frustrations & Takeaways**  

- **Spending more on gas fees than the token’s actual worth is infuriating.** A **$2 transaction** quickly turns into a **$5 problem**.  
- **Bridging and swapping funds feels unnecessarily complex.** The **gas-to-move-gas** dependency is frustrating, forcing users to spend more just to get started.  
- **Testnets requiring mainnet tokens defeats the purpose.** The goal is to **experiment**, yet the system forces users to **hold real assets first**.  
- **Still no idea where the MATIC from MetaMask’s Coinbase integration went.** It’s **not in MetaMask**, **not on Polygonscan**, and there’s no clear way to **track it down**.  

---

## **Next Steps**  

1. **Investigate the missing MATIC purchase.** If it **never processed**, look into an alternative method for acquiring **testnet funds**.  
2. **If MATIC arrives, use just enough for gas fees** to move the **WETH to MetaMask**.  
3. **Once gas fees are covered, swap WETH for MATIC or POL** (whichever is needed to proceed).  
4. **Resume the main goal: deploying the contract on Amoy** without running out of funds.  

### **Biggest Issue Right Now**  
Having **assets trapped with no way to move them** is a serious usability problem. This experience highlights why people get frustrated with **crypto onboarding**. If the **next session** happens, the primary goal will be securing even the **smallest amount of working funds** on **Polygon PoS** and **finally deploying the contract**.
