**Creating NFT Metadata and Uploading to IPFS (Web3.Storage)**

**Date:** 250321

**Project:** NFT Collection #1 ("Aurora's Echo" and 9 others)

---

### Step 1: Prepare Image Files
- Created 10 digital paintings, saved as PNG files.
- Named sequentially: `painting_01.png`, `painting_02.png`, etc.

### Step 2: Upload Paintings to IPFS
- Used [https://web3.storage/](https://web3.storage/) to upload all 10 painting images.
- Each file received a unique IPFS CID.
- Confirmed image availability by visiting:
  `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>/<filename>.png`

### Step 3: Write Metadata JSON Files
- Created names and descriptions for each painting.
- Format:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Aurora's Echo",
    "description": "A feathered traveler bathed in the hues of dawn...",
    "image": "ipfs://<CID>/painting_01.png"
  }
  ```
- Wrote a Python script (`generate_metadata.py`) to generate all 10 metadata JSON files. this fiile can be found in blockchain/scripts folder.
- Important correction: Replaced incorrect links like `ipfs://...ipfs.w3s.link` with proper IPFS paths.

### Step 4: Upload Metadata to Web3.Storage
- Uploaded the `metadata/` folder to Web3.Storage.
- Copied the root CID (for use in the smart contract).
- Verified metadata accessibility:
  - Opened: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<metadata_CID>/metadata1.json`
  - Checked that `image` field correctly pointed to painting PNG.
  - Previewed images by replacing `ipfs://` with `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/`

### Whatâ€™s Working 
- All metadata and image files load correctly via IPFS.
- Each metadata file has:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Valid IPFS image link

### Next Step
- Write smart contract (`TopSecurityNFT.sol`) using `tokenURI()` pattern:
  ```solidity
  function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view override returns (string memory) {
      return string(abi.encodePacked("ipfs://<metadata_CID>/metadata", Strings.toString(tokenId), ".json"));
  }
  ```
- Deploy to Polygon Mumbai and test first mint!

---

**Notes:**
- This process was stressful at times, especially verifying IPFS links and getting the image references right.
- Learned that `ipfs://` is preferred in metadata, and platforms like OpenSea will resolve it via gateway.

**Status:** Metadata is complete and verified. Smart contract phase begins next.


**Project:** CLI Setup

## What Was Completed

### Installed Node and NVM
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Added to `.zshrc`:
```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Then installed and used Node:
```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Installed Web3.Storage CLI
```bash
npm install -g web3.storage
```

### Attempted Web3.Storage Upload
- Uploaded zipped metadata folder, but resulted in a download-only CID
- Attempted to generate API key at web3.storage, but the page did not load
- CLI is installed and ready

---

## To-Do List for Next Session

### 1. Get a Working API Key
Try the following:
- [https://web3.storage/account](https://web3.storage/account)

Set it in terminal:
```bash
export WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN="your-api-key-here"
```

Optional: add it to `.zshrc`:
```bash
echo 'export WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Upload Metadata Folder via CLI
```bash
cd ~/2025NFT
web3.storage upload --name "My NFT Metadata" --directory metadata
```

Copy the returned CID and verify:
```
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<your_cid_here>/metadata1.json
```

### 3. Use CID in Smart Contract
Update contract to use:
```solidity
baseURI = "ipfs://<your_cid_here>/";
```

### 4. Get Test MATIC for Polygon Mumbai
- Visit: [https://faucet.polygon.technology](https://faucet.polygon.technology)
- Check wallet balance at: [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)

### 5. Deploy and Mint
- Deploy contract using Foundry
- Mint 1 token for testing
- View it on OpenSea testnet view

---

## Status
- Metadata: Complete and verified
- Smart Contract: Ready to deploy
- Web3 Upload: Waiting on folder CID
- Test MATIC: Pending
- Deployment: Next step after CID and funding
