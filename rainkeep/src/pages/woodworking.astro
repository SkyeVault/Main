      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>
        Matthew Merwin is a sculptor, builder, and digital artist based in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
        With over 20 years of experience in woodworking, barn restoration, and fine home construction, his work
        bridges traditional craftsmanship with contemporary form.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether carving walnut by hand or sculpting digitally in Nomad on his iPad, Matthew’s pieces carry
        the rhythm of the human hand and the precision of artistic intention. His practice includes work
        in <strong>wood</strong>, <strong>bronze</strong>, <strong>aluminum</strong>, <strong>clay</strong>, and <strong>3D modeling tools</strong>—all
        approached with deep respect for material and story.

      <h2>Digital & 3D Work</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to physical sculpture, Matthew creates 3D digital works using apps like <strong>Nomad</strong>, blending his
        knowledge of form with new tools. These pieces can be used for <em>rendering concepts, product design, 3D printing, NFTs,</em> and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        His digital process mirrors his physical work: intuitive, precise, and built to last.

      <h2>Studio Ethos</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “Each piece begins with a conversation — with the material, the space, and the hands that shape it.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Rooted in Bucks County’s rich maker tradition, Matthew’s work is grounded in humility, precision, and the belief that
        beautiful things should be both seen and used.
