  <h1>Technical Insight — Building the Arynwood Bot</h1>

  <p>
    This project started with a simple goal: to understand what makes a chatbot feel alive.
    Using the free tier on Hugging Face, I worked with the Zephyr-7B-Beta model — lightweight enough to experiment with,
    but still powerful enough to hold a real conversation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of hardware constraints, I didn’t train a new model from scratch. Instead, I focused on system message editing
    and adjusting runtime parameters like <em>temperature</em>, <em>top-p sampling</em>, and <em>max new tokens</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Temperature controls how much randomness the bot uses. Higher values make it more creative and unpredictable; lower values
    make it more logical and focused. Top-p sampling affects how many possible next words the bot can choose from — balancing
    between creativity and precision. Max new tokens determines how much text the model is allowed to generate in a single response,
    helping it avoid memory crashes on small servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the <code>app.py</code> file, I built a custom interface with sliders for these controls so every conversation could be
    shaped in real-time — without touching the core logic. By tuning the system message, I could alter the bot’s tone and internal
    assumptions without needing to retrain it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zephyr-7B-Beta isn’t GPT-4. But it gives me something just as important: <strong>control</strong>.
    It lets me explore, experiment, and build a system I fully understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    This version of Veylan is a prototype. I plan to expand the work by hosting multiple local bots — each adapted for coding,
    writing, and research. Everything begins here: one deployment, one custom prompt, and one core question about intelligence.
