      <strong>Welcome to Syrenwork</strong>, a digital art collection of hand-drawn original paintings. This body of work explores transformation, light, and emotion through layered illustration and interactive visual media. Rooted in a love for transmutation and symbolic design, Syrenwork blends organic textures with digital precision - each piece inviting reflection and connection in a virtual space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m <strong>Lorelei Noble</strong>, an artist and craftsperson working across digital and physical mediums. While Syrenwork is devoted exclusively to digital art, I also offer templates, fabrication, and consulting services in stained glass, wood, and metal. My work includes interior components, installations, and collaborative design systems - all shaped by a commitment to intentional craftsmanship and visual resonance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to the Syrenwork collection, I create seamless patterns available on fabric and wallpaper through Spoonflower, and offer print-on-demand artwork in my Etsy shop. For high-resolution fine art prints, visit my Pictorem gallery. You can also follow my process and visual experiments on Instagram.
