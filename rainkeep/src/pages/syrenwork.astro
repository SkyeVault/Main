    Welcome to <strong>Syrenwork</strong> — a journey through the intersection of traditional
    craftsmanship and contemporary digital expression. I'm <strong>Lorelei Noble</strong>, an
    artist and craft worker. My work spans stained glass, wood and metal sculpture, digital art,
    and interactive technologies — all designed to inspire transformation and reconnection
    through emotion, light, and movement.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also provide fabrication and consulting services, from interior components and
    installations to project development and design systems.
