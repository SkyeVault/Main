  <h1>Hi, I’m Lorelei Noble.</h1>
  <p class="prompt">&gt; Full Stack Developer, Artist, and Mom</p>

  <p class="excerpt">
    I build immersive worlds, elegant code, and meaningful systems that bring art and technology together.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m a lifelong builder, dreamer, and creative technologist with a passion for integrating code and art into meaningful experiences. This website is my portfolio and documentation hub—a place where I blend the technical and the beautiful, the structured and the intuitive.

  <h2>Where I Started</h2>
  <p>
    My journey with computers began when I was five years old, learning through command-line games and exploring early software. By thirteen, I was programming in Visual Basic. Even as my career shifted, technology remained a constant thread. As an entrepreneur and clinical wellness practitioner, I built my own websites, managed digital tools, and created learning content for my students.
  </p>

  <p>
    From 2016 to 2020, I lived nomadically, following a deep calling to discover new places and new parts of myself. I taught, I healed, I built—from massage clinics to classrooms, from spreadsheets to structures. I worked as a clinical massage therapist, an instructor, a director of admissions, and a resident manager. My strength has always been transforming knowledge into systems that empower others.

  <h2>The Artistic Shift</h2>
  <p>
    In 2020, I entered the arts and everything changed. I learned TIG welding. I fused glass in kilns. I began cutting and soldering stained glass, working with wood, and building functional pieces of beauty—including my own off-grid cabin in the Washington Peninsula. That experience taught me how to work with my hands, design for reality, and imagine new worlds.

  <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
  <p>
    Today, I’m a full-time mom raising a daughter while actively building my career as a developer. I specialize in full stack development, 3D applications, and fantasy-inspired digital environments. I work with JavaScript, Rust, Python, and Solidity. I’m gaining experience in AWS, cybersecurity practices, and automations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although I’m accepted into the WGU Cybersecurity program, I’m devoting this season of my life to hands-on development, learning through real-world projects while raising Ember with presence and intention.

  <h2>Where I’m Going</h2>
  <p>
    I want to build systems that make people’s lives feel a little more magical. If someone wants a weather app in their closet that changes the color of the wall to help them dress for the day, I want to say: <strong>sure, no problem.</strong> If someone wants to automate client emails, build a fantasy-themed storefront, or run their business through a decentralized smart contract, I want to say: <strong>sure, no problem.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I see myself building smart homes, immersive galleries, e-commerce platforms, and secure infrastructure—always weaving together code and design. My path bridges logic and creativity, grounded in motherhood and elevated by imagination.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sky isn’t the limit.  
    <strong>It’s the beginning.</strong>
