  <p class="prompt">&gt; Full-Stack Developer and Graphic Artist</p>

  <p class="excerpt">
    I build immersive worlds with code and meaningful systems that bring art and technology together.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m a creative technologist with a passion for integrating automation and art into meaningful experiences.
    This website is my portfolio and documentation hub - a place where I blend the technical and the beautiful,
    the structured and the intuitive.

  <h2>Where I Started</h2>
  <p>
    My journey with computers began with Commodore 64, learning through command-line games and exploring early software.
    By thirteen, I was programming in Visual Basic. Even as my career shifted, technology remained a constant thread.
    As an entrepreneur and teacher, I built my own websites, managed digital tools, and created learning content for my students.
  </p>

  <p>
    From 2016 to 2024, I followed a deep calling to discover new places and parts of myself - living in Austin, San Francisco, and Seattle.
    I worked in clinics and studios, building everything from spreadsheets to structures, serving as a clinic instructor, admissions director,
    and systems designer.

  <h2>The Artistic Shift</h2>
  <p>
    In 2020, I began working in the arts and everything shifted toward creative output. I learned TIG welding and metal fabrication. I fused glass in kilns.
    I began cutting and soldering stained glass, working with wood, and building functional pieces of beauty - including a complete off-grid
    cabin in the Washington Peninsula. That experience taught me how to create 3D files, design for reality, and imagine new worlds.

  <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
  <p>
    Today, I’m a full-time mom while actively building my knowledge base as a developer. I specialize in full stack development,
    3D applications, and fantasy-inspired digital environments. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Rust, Python, and Solidity.
    I’m gaining experience in AWS, cybersecurity practices, and automations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although I’m accepted into the WGU Cybersecurity program, I’m devoting this season to hands-on development,
    learning through real-world projects while building this portfolio, one page at a time.

  <h2>Where I’m Going</h2>
  <p>
    I build systems that integrate sensors, automation, and secure monitoring into everyday workflows. If someone needs a room-based interface that syncs with weather APIs to adjust ambient conditions or wall displays, I want to say: <strong>sure, no problem.</strong>
If they want to automate email pipelines, deploy a themed e-commerce frontend, or run backend operations via a decentralized smart contract, I want to say: <strong>sure, no problem.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I see myself building smart homes, immersive galleries, e-commerce platforms, and secure infrastructure -
    always weaving together code and design. My path bridges logic and creativity, grounded in intuition and elevated by imagination.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sky isn’t the limit.  
    <strong>It’s the beginning.</strong>
