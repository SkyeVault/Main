  <h2 id="focus-for-the-day"><strong>Focus for the Day</strong></h2>
  <p>Today, my primary goal is to <strong>sort out my crypto
  woes</strong> and resolve the issues with acquiring <strong>testnet
  funds</strong>. Once I have the necessary <strong>MATIC or POL on the
  Polygon Amoy testnet</strong>, I’ll be able to move past this
  bottleneck and <strong>jump back into smart contract
  development</strong>.</p>
  <h2 id="immediate-priorities"><strong>Immediate
  Priorities</strong></h2>
  <ol type="1">
  <li><strong>Investigate missing MATIC purchase</strong> – Double-check
  whether the funds from MetaMask’s Coinbase integration ever
  arrived.</li>
  <li><strong>Explore alternative testnet funding methods</strong> – If
  necessary, consider:
  <ul>
  <li>Trying different <strong>Amoy faucets</strong> or community grant
  programs.</li>
  <li>Checking if anyone in the dev community can send a small amount of
  <strong>testnet POL</strong>.</li>
  <li>Looking into bridge alternatives to move funds from
  <strong>Ethereum or another chain</strong>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Ensure I have enough gas fees to move WETH</strong> – If
  successful, swap just enough MATIC for transactions and continue
  testing smart contracts.</li>
  <li><strong>Resume smart contract development</strong> – As soon as I
  have functional funds on <strong>Polygon Amoy</strong>, I’ll refocus
  on:
  <ul>
  <li>Deploying and testing <strong>MetaverseLand.sol</strong> and
  <strong>Marketplace.sol</strong>.</li>
  <li>Running on-chain simulations using <strong>REVM</strong>.</li>
  <li>Expanding contract features, such as land leasing and auction
  mechanics.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="reflection"><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
  <p>The dependency on <strong>gas fees to move funds</strong> has been
  the biggest roadblock so far. This process highlights a significant
  usability issue in blockchain development—having tokens without the
  ability to move them due to gas constraints creates a frustrating
  loop.</p>
  <p>That said, once I get past this, it should be a straight path back
  into <strong>contract deployment and metaverse development</strong>.
  The goal is to ensure I don’t lose momentum by getting stuck in
  funding logistics.</p>
  <h2 id="next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Check for missing transactions</strong> and determine if I
  need to escalate with Coinbase support.</li>
  <li><strong>Test new funding approaches</strong> to secure enough
  testnet MATIC or POL to proceed.</li>
  <li><strong>Resume smart contract deployment</strong> and get back to
  core development work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hoping that by the end of the day, I’ll have this sorted and be
  ready to move forward!</p>
