    <h1>DevLog – 250426: Closing Out April Builds</h1>
    <span class="prompt">> Log Date: 250426</span>
    <p class="excerpt">
      Wrapping up the first full month of my Astro site, I've hit my Netlify build minutes limit — but it marks a great milestone. Here's the full summary of my April projects and progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I officially reached the end of my Netlify build minutes for April, which means I won’t be able to post any new devlogs until May. This marks the completion of my first full month running my Astro-powered site, and it has been an incredibly productive start.
    </p>

    <h2>April Accomplishments</h2>
    <p>Here's a recap of everything built and launched this month:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Completed and launched my Astro homepage with custom terminal-style theming.</li>
      <li>Created the DevLog HTML template standard to unify my blog posts into a terminal-themed aesthetic.</li>
      <li>Deployed my working AI chatbot (Arynwood Robot) built with Gradio and Hugging Face Inference API.</li>
      <li>Started customizing and modifying my chatbot’s <code>app.py</code> and exploring feeding it custom documents.</li>
      <li>Successfully built and launched my first 3D <strong>Three.js Gallery</strong> online using CDN imports, overcoming CSP and module errors.</li>
      <li>Started implementing loading optimizations and preview render improvements for faster gallery load times.</li>
      <li>Learned practical GitHub hosting workflows for my web projects and blog updates.</li>
      <li>Documented all technical hurdles in daily devlogs to create a professional programming portfolio.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Despite the wins, there were challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hugging Face free tier limits made scaling my AI experiments difficult.</li>
      <li>My MacBook’s RAM and processing speed limited heavier tasks like model finetuning and Blender 3D edits.</li>
      <li>Running out of Netlify build minutes earlier than expected showed how active I was — but also a limit I'll plan for next month.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    <p>May will bring a new chapter of development goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimize Three.js gallery layout and mobile performance.</li>
      <li>Expand the chatbot features, possibly experimenting with local models or self-hosted AI options.</li>
      <li>Continue migrating older devlogs from HTML into Astro components for long-term scalability.</li>
      <li>Balance all of it with the big milestone — my daughter is almost crawling! Time management will be even more important as I work around her exciting growth milestones.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      April 2025 was the month I officially put myself back into serious coding mode after a long hiatus. Between web development, AI exploration, and 3D graphics, I rebuilt the starting point of a real technical portfolio.
      No matter how fast or slow next month goes, the foundation has been set. Now it’s time to build on it.
