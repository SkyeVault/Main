<p>DevLog 250302: The Shift to Rust and Transparent DevOps</p>
<p>Where We’ve Been</p>
<p>SkyeVault Ops began as an experiment in AWS security and automation,
with a focus on understanding cloud security best practices and
improving workflows through automation. The initial work involved
scripting and infrastructure setup, but it became clear that existing
approaches were limiting scalability, security, and maintainability.</p>
<p>Early efforts were focused on: • Setting up AWS security monitoring
tools • Automating infrastructure with simple scripts • Exploring cloud
security principles through hands-on projects</p>
<p>While these efforts provided a solid foundation, they exposed
fundamental inefficiencies in traditional DevOps approaches. Scripting
languages like Python and Bash, while useful, lacked the performance,
memory safety, and reliability needed for long-term scaling.</p>
<p>This realization led to a decision: SkyeVault Ops needed to
evolve.</p>
<p>Where We’re Going</p>
<p>The next phase of SkyeVault Ops is a full transition to Rust-based
DevOps and security automation. This shift is not just about changing a
programming language—it’s about adopting a new way of thinking about
security, performance, and transparency in development.</p>
<p>The key areas of focus moving forward:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rust as the Core of SkyeVault Ops</li>
</ol>
<p>Rust provides: • Memory safety without garbage collection, reducing
security risks. • Concurrency without data races, making automation
tools more efficient. • Performance at the level of C/C++, ensuring that
cloud security tools run efficiently.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on traditional scripting, SkyeVault Ops will be
built as a modular, high-performance security automation framework.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Fully Transparent DevOps</li>
</ol>
<p>This project will document everything, from design decisions to
technical challenges. Transparency will be achieved through: • Detailed
DevLogs outlining progress, roadblocks, and solutions. • Clear CI/CD
workflows that automate testing, deployments, and security checks. •
Publicly available tools and resources that contribute to open-source
security.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>GitLab as a Potential Home for SkyeVault Ops</li>
</ol>
<p>While GitHub has been the primary platform, GitLab offers advantages
for security-focused DevOps workflows. This transition will involve: •
Evaluating GitLab CI/CD as an alternative to GitHub Actions. • Exploring
self-hosting options for full control over infrastructure. • Comparing
feature sets to determine if GitLab is the right fit for the
project.</p>
<p>If GitLab proves to be the better choice, SkyeVault Ops will fully
migrate. If not, the project will remain on GitHub with select
integrations from GitLab where needed.</p>
<p>Next Steps</p>
<p>The immediate focus is on: 1. Refactoring initial scripts into Rust
for better performance and reliability. 2. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline
that supports Rust development and automated security testing. 3.
Publishing the first Rust-based security tool as part of the SkyeVault
Ops framework.</p>
<p>This transition marks a new direction—one that aligns with modern
security engineering, automation best practices, and DevOps
transparency.</p>
<p>Future updates will go deeper into technical implementations,
challenges, and breakthroughs.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning.</p>
