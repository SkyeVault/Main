    <p>
      Astro has a learning curve, and I’m still getting the hang of how layouts and styling work together.
      For a while, I was importing <code>global.css</code> manually on every page and still running into
      style issues — especially with Markdown blog posts.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I’ve finally figured out is that <strong>layouts are the key to consistency</strong>. If you import
      <code>global.css</code> once inside a layout like <code>BaseLayout.astro</code>, then every page that
      uses that layout will automatically inherit all your global styles. No need to manually import them again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if a page or post accidentally imports <code>global.css</code> again, it won’t break anything — Astro
      and the browser will just apply the styles once. Still, it’s cleaner to move that import to the layout only.
    </p>

      Next step: I’m going to clean up my layout files and set up a minimal structure that applies global styles
      automatically. I’ll start fresh and build layout components I actually use — so I never have to debug CSS
      imports on a per-page basis again.
