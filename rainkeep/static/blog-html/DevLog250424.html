    <span class="prompt">> Log Date: 2025-04-24</span>
    <p class="excerpt">
      Today I tested multiple Hugging Face models and finally stood up a free version of my Arynwood Robot — currently named Veylan. This post documents where I hit walls with local installs, where I found success, and what remains to be styled and refined.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started the day by attempting to install <code>phi-4</code> locally. This model was just released by Microsoft and is promising in benchmarks — however, my 2016 MacBook Air simply couldn't handle it. No GPU, and barely any VRAM. I saw errors and slowdowns almost immediately when loading the weights via <code>transformers</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After abandoning the local route, I pivoted to trying a series of Hugging Face-hosted models. I attempted to stand up Spaces using <code>microsoft/phi-2</code>, <code>mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct</code>, and <code>HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta</code>. However, most of these either required paid inference endpoints, exceeded free-tier compute limits, or returned “no API found” errors because the model was incompatible with static CPU deployments.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      I finally had success by using <code>HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta</code> via the <code>InferenceClient</code> with Gradio’s <code>ChatInterface</code>. This setup doesn’t require API keys as long as the model supports hosted inference. I created a new Space named <strong>veylan</strong>, and used a simplified <code>app.py</code> that streams responses.
    </p>

    <pre><code>client = InferenceClient("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta")</code></pre>

    <p>
      The assistant currently accepts a user-defined system message and has sliders for <code>max_tokens</code>, <code>temperature</code>, and <code>top_p</code>. It's clean, fast, and feels close to the goal. 
    </p>

    <h3>What’s Left</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom CSS pass: needs softer lavender glow and spacing tweaks</li>
      <li>Header/description updates to better reflect the project vision</li>
      <li>Add example prompts for inspiration</li>
      <li>Optional: toggle between tones (technical vs poetic)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Next steps: finish styling the interface, refine the assistant voice, and eventually explore hosting an actual open-source model myself if I ever get better hardware. For now, the project lives in the cloud and is fully functional — no API keys, no fees.
