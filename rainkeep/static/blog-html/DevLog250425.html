    <h1>DevLog 250425 – Pushing the Limits of Zephyr Bot</h1>
    <span class="prompt">> Log Date: 2025-04-25</span>
    <p class="excerpt">
      Today I reached the limit of what my local machine can handle with my Zephyr bot project. I stretched the system until it cracked, and realized it's time for some serious upgrades.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spent today editing and updating the personality features for my Hugging Face-based Zephyr bot. I added logging functions and tried introducing more customized behavior into <code>app.py</code>. However, the 16GB memory of my Hugging Face free tier quickly showed its limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every new tweak and addition pushed the system harder. After a few iterations, my laptop — already strained — simply couldn’t handle it. I attempted to install and run <strong>phi-4</strong> locally, and it essentially crashed the machine. Opening Blender? Forget about it. Running a personal LLM? Out of reach for now.
    </p>

    <h2>Upgrade Plans</h2>
    <p>
      It's clear that if I want to continue building my own AI systems and running models locally, I need stronger hardware. 
      I'm currently looking at starting with an <strong>M4 Mac Mini</strong> with at least <strong>16GB RAM</strong>. This would give me enough baseline performance to continue growing my skills without hitting a memory wall every few steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long term, I want to build a full customized system — designed specifically for AI development, 3D rendering, and local LLM hosting. I imagine an expandable workstation where I can host my bots, build my art, and continue crafting every part of the system.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Hugging Face free tier has been an excellent playground. It showed me where my limits currently are, but more importantly, it showed me where I want to go. 
      Pushing Zephyr bot to its current limits taught me a lot about architecture, memory usage, and the reality of running AI models in constrained environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      I will continue tweaking <code>app.py</code> and refining the experience. In the meantime, it’s time to build a stronger foundation for the future.
    </p>

    <h3>Today's Key Commands</h3>
    <pre><code># Sample startup
huggingface-cli login
python app.py

# Sample install attempt for phi-4
pip install phi-4

# Blender crash confirmed
open -a Blender
    </code></pre>
