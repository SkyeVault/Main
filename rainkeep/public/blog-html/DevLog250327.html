  250327: Test Launch Results &amp; NFT Display Debugging</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-03-27<br />
  <strong>Project:</strong> TopSecurityNFT<br />
  <strong>Network:</strong> Polygon Amoy Testnet<br />
  <strong>Tooling:</strong> Foundry, Web3.Storage, OpenSea Testnet</p>

  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>Today marked a milestone with the <strong>successful test
  launch</strong> of the <code>TopSecurityNFT</code> contract on the
  <strong>Polygon Amoy testnet</strong>. Most of the collection
  <strong>minted and rendered correctly</strong>, and the entire
  collection was <strong>automatically indexed by OpenSea
  testnet</strong> without requiring any manual input.</p>
  <p>However, there were a few visual bugs during testing.
  Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Painting #4</strong> and <strong>Painting #10</strong> did
  <strong>not render</strong> on OpenSea.</li>
  <li>All other metadata files appeared valid and matched expected
  formatting.</li>
  <li>No syntax errors were detected in the JSON files, which makes this
  behavior somewhat ambiguous.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="debugging-notes">Debugging Notes</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Confirmed that all 10 tokens were successfully minted.</li>
  <li>Re-uploaded metadata to Web3.Storage to rule out CID or upload
  issues.</li>
  <li>Opened the metadata manually via IPFS gateway – files for Token 4
  and 10 load as expected.</li>
  <li>Suspected potential casing mismatch or naming inconsistency
  between <code>tokenURI()</code> construction and actual file
  names.</li>
  <li>Considered image size or encoding errors as possible causes but
  could not reproduce locally.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Thank god for testnet funds.</strong> Testing this without
  cost enabled full deployment and error identification before mainnet
  publishing.</li>
  <li>OpenSea <strong>indexing was automatic</strong>, which confirms
  the contract metadata structure is valid and conforms to
  standards.</li>
  <li>Foundry, IPFS, and Polygon are working well together in this
  workflow.</li>
  <li>Realized the importance of deterministic metadata generation and
  consistent image references.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Start fresh with a new contract deployment
  tomorrow.</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Reset the <code>TopSecurityNFT</code> contract to ensure clean
  indexing.</li>
  <li>Regenerate all metadata files with fully verified naming and
  casing.</li>
  <li>Upload to a new CID on Web3.Storage and update the
  <code>baseURI</code>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Mint tokens again on testnet and verify all images load
  correctly.</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Focus specifically on image formatting and edge-case rendering
  bugs.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If all tokens display correctly, proceed to prepare for
  <strong>mainnet deployment.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p>This session was a reminder that <strong>testnets exist for a
  reason</strong>—to break things safely. One more try, then it’s
  go-time for production.</p>
