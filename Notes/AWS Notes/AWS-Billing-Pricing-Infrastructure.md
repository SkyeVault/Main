# AWS Billing, Pricing, and Infrastructure Study Guide

## **1. AWS Global Infrastructure**
AWS operates in multiple **Regions**, **Availability Zones (AZs)**, and **Edge Locations** to provide scalability, reliability, and low latency.

### **1.1 Key Components**
- **Regions:**  
  - A Region is a **geographical area** with multiple data centers.
  - Example: `us-east-1 (N. Virginia)`, `eu-west-1 (Ireland)`.
  - Choose a Region based on **latency, compliance, and cost**.
  
- **Availability Zones (AZs):**  
  - Each Region has **2 or more AZs** (isolated data centers).
  - AZs provide **high availability** by spreading workloads across multiple locations.

- **Edge Locations & Content Delivery (CDN):**  
  - **Amazon CloudFront** uses **Edge Locations** to cache content closer to users.
  - Improves performance by **reducing latency**.

### **1.2 Key Services and Considerations**
- **AWS Global Services** (work everywhere, not region-specific):  
  - **IAM**, **Route 53 (DNS)**, **CloudFront (CDN)**, **WAF**, **Security Hub**.

- **AWS Regional Services** (most compute and storage services):  
  - **EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB**.

- **Data Transfer Costs:**  
  - **Inbound data is free**, but **outbound data has costs**.
  - Use **VPC Peering, PrivateLink, and CloudFront** to reduce transfer costs.

## **2. AWS Pricing Models**
AWS pricing varies by service, usage, and commitment levels. Understanding the pricing models helps optimize cloud costs.

### **2.1 Main Pricing Models**
- **Pay-as-you-go:**  
  - You only pay for what you use.
  - Example: **EC2 On-Demand, Lambda Invocations, S3 Storage**.

- **Savings Plans & Reserved Instances (RI):**  
  - Commit to **1 or 3-year terms** for lower pricing.
  - Best for **predictable workloads**.

- **Spot Instances:**  
  - Up to **90% discount** on EC2 instances.
  - AWS can **terminate spot instances anytime** if capacity is needed.

- **Dedicated Hosts:**  
  - **Physical EC2 servers** dedicated to your account.
  - Required for **compliance-heavy workloads**.

## **3. AWS Cost Management & Billing**
AWS offers several tools to help monitor and control cloud spending.

### **3.1 AWS Billing Dashboard**
- View **current usage, past invoices, and estimated costs**.
- Set up **budgets and alerts**.

### **3.2 AWS Budgets**
- Set spending limits for **services, accounts, and regions**.
- Receive **alerts** via SNS when costs exceed the threshold.

### **3.3 AWS Cost Explorer**
- **Visualize AWS spending trends** over time.
- **Analyze** where costs are coming from (e.g., EC2, S3, Data Transfer).

### **3.4 AWS Trusted Advisor (Cost Optimization)**
- Provides **recommendations** to reduce costs.
- Includes:
  - **Underutilized EC2 instances**
  - **Idle RDS databases**
  - **S3 storage cost optimization**

### **3.5 AWS Pricing Calculator**
- Estimates **total AWS costs** before deploying resources.
- Useful for **predicting monthly costs** based on expected usage.

## **4. AWS Support Plans**
AWS offers **4 support plans** with different levels of service.

| Support Plan | Cost | Response Time | Features |
|-------------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Basic** | Free | Community forums, self-help docs | No direct AWS support |
| **Developer** | Starts at $29/month | < 24 hours for general issues | Best for non-production workloads |
| **Business** | Starts at $100/month | < 1 hour for critical issues | Trusted Advisor checks, AWS Support API |
| **Enterprise** | Starts at $15,000/month | < 15 min for critical issues | Dedicated TAM (Technical Account Manager), Concierge Support |

## **5. AWS Pricing Best Practices**
### **5.1 Reduce EC2 Costs**
- **Use Auto Scaling** to match demand.
- Choose **Savings Plans or Reserved Instances** for steady workloads.
- Use **Spot Instances** for temporary workloads.

### **5.2 Optimize S3 Storage Costs**
- Move old data to **Glacier** (cheaper long-term storage).
- Use **Lifecycle Policies** to automatically transition data between tiers.

### **5.3 Minimize Data Transfer Costs**
- Use **CloudFront CDN** to cache content closer to users.
- Enable **VPC Endpoints** to avoid NAT Gateway costs.

---

## **6. AWS Compliance & Shared Responsibility Model**
AWS follows a **Shared Responsibility Model**, meaning security is divided between **AWS (the cloud provider)** and **the customer (you).**

### **6.1 AWS Responsibilities ("Security of the Cloud")**
- **Physical security** of data centers.
- **Network infrastructure** security.
- **Hypervisor and virtualization security**.

### **6.2 Customer Responsibilities ("Security in the Cloud")**
- **IAM user management** and least privilege access.
- **Application security** (patching, encryption).
- **Data classification and protection**.

---

## **7. AWS Free Tier**
AWS offers **a free tier** for trying out AWS services.

### **7.1 Free Tier Types**
- **Always Free** (available indefinitely):
  - IAM, Lambda (1M requests/month), DynamoDB (25GB storage).
- **12-Month Free Tier** (expires after a year):
  - EC2 (750 hours/month), S3 (5GB), RDS (750 hours).
- **Trial-Based Free Tier** (short-term access):
  - AWS Redshift (free for 2 months).

### **7.2 Monitoring Free Tier Usage**
- Use the **AWS Billing Dashboard** to track free tier limits.
- Set up **alerts** to avoid unexpected charges.

## **8. AWS Cost Optimization Strategies**
- [ ] **Use Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads.
- [ ] **Enable Auto Scaling** to reduce over-provisioning.
- [ ] **Monitor costs using AWS Budgets & Cost Explorer**.
- [ ] **Leverage Reserved Instances or Savings Plans** for long-term cost savings.
- [ ] **Move infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage tiers (Glacier, S3 IA)**.

---

## **Final Notes**
- **Billing & Pricing Questions**: Expect multiple-choice questions about **AWS pricing models**, **support plans**, and **cost management tools**.
- **Global Infrastructure Questions**: Be familiar with **Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations**, and **how AWS services scale globally**.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Know what AWS secures vs. what **you** must secure.
