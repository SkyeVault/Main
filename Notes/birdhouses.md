## Construction Guidelines

### **Materials**
- **Best Woods**: Cedar, cypress (naturally rot-resistant)
- **Good Options**: Pine, oak (treat with non-toxic sealers)
- **Avoid**: Treated lumber, metal, plastic
- **Hardware**: Galvanized or stainless steel screws/nails

### **Design Features**
- **Drainage**: 1/4" holes in floor corners
- **Ventilation**: Small holes near roof line
- **Entrance**: No perch (helps exclude starlings/sparrows)
- **Roof**: Slanted with 2-3" overhang for weather protection
- **Access**: Hinged or removable side for cleaning

### **Installation Tips**
- **Timing**: Install February-March before breeding season
- **Orientation**: Face entrance away from prevailing winds (generally east/southeast)
- **Predator Guards**: Use baffles on poles, keep away from cat access
- **Spacing**: Same species houses should be 100+ yards apart
- **Maintenance**: Clean out between broods and annually

## Regional Considerations for Bucks County

### **Climate Adaptations**
- Use thicker walls (3/4") for insulation
- Ensure adequate ventilation for humid summers
- Position to avoid afternoon sun exposure

### **Local Ecosystem**
- **Wetland Areas**: Ideal for tree swallows, red-winged blackbirds
- **Suburban Areas**: House wrens, chickadees, titmice
- **Agricultural Land**: Bluebirds, tree swallows
- **Forested Areas**: Woodpeckers, nuthatches, woodland species

### **Seasonal Timeline**

- **August**: Second broods
- **September-October**: Clean out houses
- **November-January**: Maintenance period

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **House Sparrow/Starling Problems**
- Remove perches
- Use 1.25" holes (too small for starlings)
- Install houses away from human dwellings

### **Predation Issues**
- Install predator guards on poles
- Keep houses 5+ feet from jumping surfaces
- Use deeper boxes for ground-level threats

### **Maintenance Schedule**
- **Weekly**: Check for damage during season
- **Monthly**: Remove competing nests (sparrows)
- **Seasonally**: Deep clean and repair
- **Annually**: Replace weathered components
