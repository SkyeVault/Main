# ðŸŽµ Rust Spotify Playlist Maker ðŸŽµ
Rust Program Documentation

This Rust program automates playlist creation on Spotify using the `rspotify` library. It authenticates users, searches for songs, and creates a playlist with predefined tracks. Edit the playlist name and song selection choices inside the code at line 66 and 71 of spotify_playlist_maker/src/main.rs.

## Features
- OAuth2 authentication with Spotify (no need to manually enter tokens)
- Automated playlist creation
- Song search and addition
- Uses `tiny_http` to handle the authentication callback automatically

---

Before running the program, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Rust and Cargo** (if not already installed)  
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. **Spotify Developer Account**  
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Add the following **Redirect URIs**:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
     http://localhost:8888/callback
