## My Journey: From Web Design to Cloud Security
My path has been anything but linear, weaving through different creative and technical fields before landing in AWS Cloud Security. This journey started with a love for code and web design, transitioned into graphic arts, and now leads me into the world of cloud security and infrastructure.

### How It Started: Web Design & Graphic Arts
I started in the world of web design, fascinated by the way code and visuals come together to create interactive experiences. Over time, my focus shifted toward graphic arts, exploring digital illustration, branding, and seamless pattern design. Creating structured, visually compelling work has always been at the heart of my interests.

### Transitioning into Cloud Security
While working with design and technology, I became increasingly drawn to security, automation, and cloud computing. Understanding how digital infrastructures are built, protected, and optimized is a natural extension of my technical background. Now, I'm diving deep into AWS security best practices, IAM policies, networking, and real-world cybersecurity applications.

### Introducing SkyeVault
As part of this transition, I'm working on a new project called SkyeVault, which focuses on documenting cloud security practices, creating automation scripts, and building a strong AWS security portfolio. 

### The 'Main' Repository: My Knowledge Hub
This repository serves as the central hub for everything I am learning, building, and exploring in the cloud security space. It is structured to include:
- Cloud Security Projects – Hands-on security experiments and configurations.
- AWS Security Labs – Step-by-step breakdowns of AWS security features.
- Infrastructure Hardening – Best practices for securing EC2, S3, IAM, and networking.
- Scripts & Automation – Useful tools for security monitoring and cloud operations.

### What's Next?
- Building SkyeVault as a structured project.
- Documenting real-world AWS security implementations.
- Sharing lessons learned in IAM, network security, and cloud automation.
- Expanding my portfolio with projects that showcase practical cloud security applications.

I’m excited to combine creativity, structure, and security to build something meaningful. This is just the beginning.
