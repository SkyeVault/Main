## Current Focus
### SkyeVault Ops: Transition to Rust and DevOps Transparency
**Vision Statement:**  
SkyeVault Ops is evolving into a fully Rust-based cloud security and automation project. The focus is on:
- High-performance security tooling
- AWS security automation
- Transparent DevOps workflows
- Exploring a transition to GitLab for CI/CD and project management

---

## What I’m Working On
- Building a Rust-based cloud security automation framework
- Automating security workflows in AWS using Rust and Python
- Expanding full-stack security applications with integrated logging and security telemetry

---

## My Journey
I started in web design and graphic arts before shifting my focus to cloud security and Rust development.  
My goal is to build expertise in:
- AWS security hardening
- Infrastructure automation
- Scalable security architectures

---

## What’s Next?
- Expanding AWS security documentation
- Implementing real-world security hardening strategies
- Developing automation tools for cloud security
