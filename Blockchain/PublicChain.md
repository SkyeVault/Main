# US Public Chain

**A transparent blockchain framework for modernizing public assistance and government payroll.  
Built for dignity, equity, and systemic trust.**

## Why Blockchain?

It’s a decentralized ledger — a programmable, verifiable system that removes middlemen, makes transactions transparent, and creates accountability by design.

When applied correctly, blockchain can:
- Prevent corruption through public verification
- Automate trust without gatekeeping
- Deliver funds directly to people who need them
- Ensure every tax dollar is traceable

**US Public Chain** applies these core strengths to the public sector — transforming how aid is distributed and how public workers are compensated, with clarity and fairness for all.

## The Problem

Public aid is slow, fragmented, and hard to track.  
Government payroll is often inefficient, delayed, or unclear.  
Spending is buried in bureaucracy, difficult to audit, and vulnerable to misuse.  

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency is being politicized and stockpiled — its utility overlooked in favor of speculative value.

We don’t need more accumulation.  
We need **application**.

Crypto is not a trophy, it's a tool.

## Solution

**US Public Chain** introduces a two-token blockchain ecosystem for the public sector:

---

### 1. Public Assistance Token (PAT)

A non-speculative, non-transferable token for recipients of public aid.

**Use cases:**
- Food
- Public healthcare
- Fuel
- Public transit
- Utilities
- Basic clothing and toiletries
- Housing and transitional services

**Key features:**
- Resets monthly (no stockpiling)
- Cannot be converted or traded
- Fully traceable but anonymized for privacy
- Usable only at verified providers within essential categories

---

### 2. USDC for Public Workers

Stablecoin-based payroll for government and essential public service workers.

**Eligible roles:**
- Emergency services
- Educators
- Healthcare workers
- Government employees (local, state, federal)
- Infrastructure and transportation workers

**Key features:**
- Spendable, saveable, and convertible
- Remaining balance rolls over monthly
- Fully transparent salary tracking
- Encourages accountability without restriction

---

## Who It Serves

### Assistance Recipients
- Disabled individuals
- Veterans
- Senior citizens
- Children under 18 in low-income households
- Pregnant women and mothers with low household income
- Unemployed individuals verified through labor records

### Public Workers
- Verified public employees paid through state or federal systems
- Salaries visible on-chain to promote fair pay and trust

## How It Works

```

├── contracts/          # Smart contracts for PAT and USDC logic
├── frontend/           # User interface for recipients, workers, and the public
├── data/               # Token flow simulation and program analytics

```
**Public dashboards** allow citizens to view:
- Total monthly aid issued
- Payroll distribution
- Budget allocations and spending patterns

**Smart contracts** automate all disbursements and eliminate administrative bottlenecks.

**Privacy protections** ensure recipient data is protected while maintaining full traceability of public funds.

## Future Plans

- Mobile-friendly public wallet cards for recipients  
- DAO-governed community budgeting tools  
- Token-based voting for local use of public funds  
- Open-source APIs for city, state, and nonprofit integration  
- International templates for global deployment

---

## Technology

- **Blockchain:** Polygon (Amoy testnet for proof of concept)
- **Contracts:** Solidity (Hardhat or Foundry)
- **Frontend:** Astro or React with Tailwind CSS
- **Data Viz:** D3.js or Recharts
- **Wallets:** MetaMask, WalletConnect
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, IPFS

## Why This Matters

We don’t need to imagine a better system — we can build it.  
We have the tools to automate aid, eliminate corruption, and honor the dignity of both the worker and the recipient.

US Public Chain is a prototype for how decentralized tech can bring transparency and structure to the very systems meant to support us.

This is crypto applied with intention.  
This is blockchain for public good.

## About the Creator

**Written by Lorelei Noble – Developer. Artist. Mother. Citizen.**

I build ethical systems for the future I want my daughter to grow up in — one where transparency, fairness, and dignity aren’t ideals, but defaults.

My passion is cloud security, smart contract architecture, Web3 infrastructure, and decentralized platforms. My philosophy is rooted in open-source solutions,  using tools like Solidity, Rust, Foundry, and IPFS.

This project is not theoretical. It’s deeply personal. And it’s within our reach.
