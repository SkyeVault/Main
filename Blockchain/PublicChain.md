# US Public Chain

**A transparent blockchain system for public assistance and government payroll.  
Built to restore dignity, traceability, and purpose to how we distribute value in the United States.**

---

## Project Vision

US Public Chain is a decentralized system designed to tokenize government aid and public payroll in a way that serves people first—not politics, not speculation.

This project was created by Lorelei Noble, a blockchain developer, digital artist, and systems thinker, driven by a lifelong desire to use technology not to hoard wealth—but to heal broken systems.

In a time when cryptocurrency is being hoarded for power, politicized for control, and misunderstood by the public, this project reclaims its original purpose: to decentralize trust, automate transparency, and build a fair, open infrastructure for human dignity.

## Philosophy

- Crypto was never meant to be a trophy. It’s a tool.
- Blockchain must be used for real-world utility, not speculative hoarding.
- Transparency is not surveillance—it’s accountability.
- Aid should be delivered with dignity, efficiency, and clarity.
- Workers deserve verifiable, stable compensation without delay or bureaucracy.
- The government should be held to the same standards it asks of its people.

## Developer Background

Created by Lorelei Noble — a developer, artist, and mother.

Lorelei has experience in:

- Cloud security and AWS
- Solidity and Rust smart contracts
- NFT deployment on Polygon
- Ethical Web3 infrastructure
- Open-source public systems

This project is rooted in both technical knowledge and lived experience. It’s built from the ground up to imagine the systems we never got—but always needed.

## System Design

### Dual Token Economy

**1. Public Assistance Token (PAT)**  
- Non-transferable, non-speculative, resets monthly  
- Can only be used for:
  - Food
  - Healthcare
  - Transportation
  - Fuel
  - Utilities (incl. internet)
  - Basic clothing and toiletries
  - Housing and transitional housing
- Prevents stockpiling or off-chain abuse
- Designed to protect dignity and ensure survival

**2. USDC for Public Workers**  
- Salary paid to:
  - Educators
  - Healthcare workers
  - Emergency responders
  - Road and transit workers
  - Government employees
- Spendable, saveable, and convertible
- Leftover balance rolls over monthly
- Full transparency in payroll

## Eligibility

**Recipients include:**  
- Disabled individuals  
- Veterans  
- Seniors  
- Children in low-income households  
- Pregnant women and mothers with low income  
- Verified unemployed

**Public servants include:**  
- Emergency services  
- Educators

## Transparency Architecture

- All transactions are on-chain  
- Contracts are open-source  
- Public dashboards show monthly spending, distributions, and efficiency metrics  
- Recipient privacy is protected with anonymized IDs

## Why This Matters

The current system is slow, fragmented, and hidden from public view. Aid is delayed. Workers are underpaid. Tax dollars vanish into black boxes.

Meanwhile, crypto is being hoarded and politicized instead of implemented for good.

US Public Chain is a tool to change that—**one smart contract at a time.**

Let’s put the government on chain.  
Let’s use crypto the way it was meant to be used: for people.
