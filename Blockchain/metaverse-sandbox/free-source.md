## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| 3D Engine | Three.js (lightweight) or Babylon.js (advanced) |
| Smart Contracts | Ethereum Layer 2 (Polygon or Arbitrum for lower fees) |
| NFT Marketplace | OpenZeppelin ERC-721/ERC-1155 contracts |
| Wallet Authentication | MetaMask, WalletConnect |
| Storage | IPFS for NFTs and metadata, Arweave for long-term storage |
| Social Features | WebRTC for voice/video chat, Livepeer for streaming |
| Hosting | Fleek (IPFS hosting), Vercel (for fallback) |

## Step 1: Build the Web3 NFT Gallery
Users should be able to navigate a digital space and view NFTs as they would in a real-world gallery.

### Tools
- Three.js for rendering a 3D environment
- MetaMask authentication for user login
- Smart contracts to manage NFT ownership

### Example Solidity Smart Contract for NFT-Based Land Ownership

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract VirtualLand is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 public nextTokenId;
    mapping(uint256 => string) private _tokenURIs;

    constructor() ERC721("VirtualLand", "LAND") {}

    function mintLand(string memory tokenURI) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);
        _tokenURIs[tokenId] = tokenURI;
    }

    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view override returns (string memory) {
        return _tokenURIs[tokenId];
    }
}
```

This contract allows users to own land as NFTs, with metadata pointing to the 3D model or environment stored on IPFS.

---

## Step 2: Create the Land Ownership Marketplace
Users can buy, sell, or rent virtual land inside the metaverse.

### Tools
- OpenZeppelin’s ERC-721 and ERC-1155 contracts
- A smart contract-driven marketplace for handling land transactions
- Web3-based payment integration for ETH, MATIC, or stablecoins

### Example Solidity Smart Contract for Land Sales

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract LandMarketplace {
    struct Listing {
        uint256 price;
        address seller;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Listing) public listings;
    IERC721 public landContract;
    IERC20 public paymentToken;

    constructor(address _landContract, address _paymentToken) {
        landContract = IERC721(_landContract);
        paymentToken = IERC20(_paymentToken);
    }

    function listLand(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price) public {
        require(landContract.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not owner");
        listings[tokenId] = Listing(price, msg.sender);
    }

    function buyLand(uint256 tokenId) public {
        Listing memory listing = listings[tokenId];
        require(paymentToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, listing.seller, listing.price), "Payment failed");
        landContract.transferFrom(listing.seller, msg.sender, tokenId);
        delete listings[tokenId];
    }
}
```

This contract allows users to list land for sale, set a price, and process Web3 transactions.

## Step 3: Enable Custom Business Spaces
Users should be able to customize their land and upload unique 3D models.

### Tools
- Babylon.js for rendering custom business environments
- IPFS for decentralized storage of user-created spaces
- Smart contracts to link 3D assets to land NFTs

### Process
1. Users upload a 3D model of their business space.
2. Metadata is stored on IPFS and linked to their NFT land.
3. When another user visits the land, the 3D model dynamically loads.

---

## Step 4: Add Social Features (Chat, Events, AI NPCs)
Users should be able to interact with others inside the virtual space.

### Tools
- WebRTC for voice and video chat
- Livepeer for decentralized live streaming
- GPT-4 API for AI-powered NPCs

---

## Free Hosting and Deployment
- Fleek – Decentralized IPFS hosting
- Vercel – Web2 hosting fallback
- Moralis – Web3 backend API for authentication and metadata management
