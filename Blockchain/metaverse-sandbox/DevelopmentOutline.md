# Web3 Hosting & NFT Virtual Gallery Development Plan  

## **Phase 1: Setting Up the 3D Virtual Museum**  
### **1. Build the Virtual Gallery with Three.js**  
- Set up a **Three.js** environment for rendering the 3D museum.  
- Create basic **walls, floor, lighting, and camera controls**.  
- Load **2D artwork (as canvases) and 3D sculptures (as GLB/OBJ models)**.  
- Place clickable doorways leading to artist spaces.  

### **2. Upload Art & Metadata to Web3.Storage (IPFS)**  
- Prepare **art files (JPEG, PNG, GLB)**.  
- Upload each file to **Web3.Storage** and retrieve its **CID**.  
- Create **JSON metadata files** for each NFT (title, description, image link, unlockable story).  
- Upload metadata files to **IPFS** and store their CIDs for later minting.  

### **3. Deploy Smart Contract for Minting Art NFTs**  
- Write an **ERC-721 contract** using **OpenZeppelin**.  
- Implement **metadata storage** for linking NFTs to IPFS files.  
- Add **unlockable content support** for NFT holders.  
- Deploy the contract to **Polygon Mumbai (testnet) for testing**.  
- Once tested, deploy to **Polygon Mainnet**.

## **Phase 2: Expanding the Museum with NFT Doorways**  
### **4. Smart Contract for "Buy a Door" NFTs**  
- Create an ERC-721 contract where each **door NFT** represents an artist’s gallery space.  
- Store **metadata for each door**, including **which gallery it leads to**.  
- Deploy to **Polygon Mainnet** and integrate with the website.  

### **5. Integrate NFTs with Three.js Gallery**  
- Make each **doorway in the virtual space** clickable.  
- If the user **owns a Door NFT**, allow them to set their **gallery link**.  
- If a visitor clicks a door, load the **owner’s IPFS-hosted gallery**.  

### **6. Marketplace Features for Selling Space**  
- List **door NFTs for sale** on OpenSea (Polygon).  
- Allow buyers to **mint a new door** directly from your contract.  
- Implement **a rental model** (monthly fee to host temporary exhibitions).

## **Phase 3: Hosting the Entire Museum on IPFS**  
### **7. Deploy the Virtual Gallery to IPFS**  
- Convert the **museum website into a static HTML/JS bundle**.  
- Upload the entire folder to **Web3.Storage**.  
- Retrieve the **CID** of the latest upload.  

### **8. Link Syrenwork.com to IPFS (DNSLink)**  
- Update your **DNS records** with a **DNSLink entry** pointing to your IPFS CID.  
- Example DNS record:  
  ```  
  _dnslink.syrenwork.com TXT "dnslink=/ipfs/YOUR_CID"  
  ```  
- Now, **syrenwork.com automatically resolves to the latest museum version on IPFS**.  

### **9. Make the Museum Web2-Friendly**  
- Web2 users can access it via an **IPFS gateway**:  
  ```  
  https://w3s.link/ipfs/YOUR_CID  
  ```  
- If they have **Brave browser or MetaMask**, they can view it **natively without a gateway**.  

---  

## **Future Features & Expansion**  
### **10. AI-Generated Story Capsules**  
- Use **AI-generated text + historical context** to create **unique narratives** for each NFT.  
- Owners can **contribute updates** to their NFT’s story over time.  

### **11. Community Collaboration & Gallery Rentals**  
- Allow artists to **rent space short-term** for curated events.  
- Let **Door NFT owners** resell their gallery space.  

### **12. Build a DAO for the Museum**  
- Offer **governance rights** to long-term supporters.  
- Community votes on **museum upgrades & new exhibitions**.

# **Notes & Next Steps**  
- **Focus Now:** Build & deploy the **basic museum space + NFT minting system**.  
- **Next Priority:** Hosting the site on **IPFS & linking Syrenwork.com**.  
- **Long-Term:** Monetize by **selling gallery space & exclusive digital art experiences**.
