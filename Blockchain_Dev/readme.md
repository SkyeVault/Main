# **Metaverse Land: Blockchain Development Roadmap**  
### *A Bootstrap Open-Source Experiment for Learning Smart Contracts and Metaverse Development*  

---

## **Overview**  
This project is an open-source initiative to build a **metaverse land system** from the ground up, without requiring initial funding. The goal is to develop a **decentralized virtual land ownership model** while learning **smart contract development, blockchain integration, and metaverse infrastructure**.  

The project follows a **step-by-step development roadmap**, breaking down complex **blockchain and metaverse concepts** into actionable tasks.  

---

## **Project Scope**  

This repository contains the **blockchain development portion** of the metaverse land system, including:  
- **Smart contracts for land NFTs (ERC-721)**  
- **Land ownership and transfer mechanisms**  
- **Decentralized storage of land metadata (IPFS)**  
- **Marketplace logic for buying and selling land NFTs**  
- **User authentication and wallet connection (MetaMask)**  
- **Integration with a 3D metaverse world**  

This experiment is designed for **learning and iteration**, with a focus on building **functional smart contracts** that can be tested and deployed on blockchain networks.

## **How to Use Foundry for This Project**  

### **1. Install Foundry**  
First, install Foundry using their script:  

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, update Foundry:  

```bash
foundryup
```

This installs:  
- **`forge`** → Builds and tests smart contracts.  
- **`cast`** → Interacts with Ethereum contracts.  
- **`anvil`** → Runs a local Ethereum testnet.  

---

### **2. Initialize the Project**  
Navigate to your **metaverse-land** folder and initialize Foundry:  

```bash
forge init metaverse-land
cd metaverse-land
```

This creates the project structure with:  

```
metaverse-land/
├── src/      # Solidity contracts
├── script/   # Deployment scripts
├── test/     # Smart contract tests
├── foundry.toml # Configuration file
```

---

### **3. Write the Land NFT Smart Contract**  
Inside `src/MetaverseLand.sol`, create an **ERC-721 NFT contract** for land ownership:  

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MetaverseLand is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    uint256 public nextTokenId;
    mapping(uint256 => LandMetadata) public landDetails;

    struct LandMetadata {
        uint256 x;
        uint256 y;
        string metadataURI;
    }

    event LandMinted(address indexed owner, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 x, uint256 y);

    constructor() ERC721("Metaverse Land", "MLAND") {}

    function mintLand(address to, uint256 x, uint256 y, string memory metadataURI) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, metadataURI);

        landDetails[tokenId] = LandMetadata(x, y, metadataURI);
        emit LandMinted(to, tokenId, x, y);
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Deploy the Contract**  
Deploy using Foundry:  

```bash
forge script script/DeployMetaverseLand.s.sol --rpc-url $GOERLI_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```
