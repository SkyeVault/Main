# AWS IAM Best Practices

This document outlines guidelines to securely manage identities and permissions in AWS. Following these best practices will help protect your AWS environment from unauthorized access.

## 1. Principle of Least Privilege

- **Grant only necessary permissions:** Ensure that users, groups, and roles have only the permissions they need for their tasks.
- **Regular reviews:** Periodically review and adjust permissions to avoid privilege creep.

## 2. Protect the Root Account

- **Minimize usage:** Do not use the root account for everyday tasks.
- **Enable MFA:** Protect the root account with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- **Create IAM users:** Use individual IAM user accounts for daily operations.

## 3. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Mandatory for privileged users:** Enable MFA for all users, especially administrators.
- **Extra security layer:** MFA adds a second step in the login process, making unauthorized access more difficult.

## 4. Use IAM Groups

- **Simplify management:** Organize users into groups and attach policies to groups rather than individual users.
- **Consistent permissions:** Ensure that users with similar responsibilities have the same permissions.

## 5. Use IAM Roles

- **For AWS services:** Use roles for AWS services like EC2 instead of storing long-term credentials.
- **Temporary access:** Use roles to grant temporary access to applications and services.
- **Avoid hardcoding credentials:** Do not embed access keys directly in your code.

## 6. Regularly Review and Rotate Credentials

- **Audit credentials:** Regularly check access keys, passwords, and certificates.
- **Rotate keys:** Change access keys periodically and remove those that are unused.
- **Enforce password policies:** Use strong passwords and require regular password updates.

## 7. Monitor IAM Activity

- **Enable CloudTrail:** Use AWS CloudTrail to log IAM activity.
- **Regular log review:** Monitor logs for any unusual or unauthorized actions.
- **Set up alerts:** Configure alerts for suspicious IAM activity.

## 8. Use Policy Conditions

- **Fine-tune access:** Add conditions to policies, such as IP restrictions or MFA requirements.
- **Increase security:** Use conditions to enforce additional layers of security beyond basic permissions.

## 9. Enforce Strong Password Policies

- **Complex passwords:** Define password policies that require complexity, length, and periodic changes.
- **Password expiration:** Set expiration periods for passwords to reduce the risk of compromised credentials.

## 10. Secure Access Keys

- **Avoid embedding keys:** Do not store access keys in code or public repositories.
- **Use AWS services:** Leverage AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager for secure key management.

## 11. Audit and Compliance

- **Regular audits:** Periodically audit IAM roles, policies, and configurations.
- **Automated tools:** Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer and AWS Config rules to check for compliance.
- **Document changes:** Keep track of changes to IAM policies and roles for future reference.
