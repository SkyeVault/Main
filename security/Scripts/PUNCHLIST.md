# AWS Security & Automation Scripts Punchlist

This punchlist outlines various security, networking, incident response, and automation scripts for managing AWS environments. Completing these scripts will provide hands-on experience with AWS security best practices and automation.

---

## Security Scripts
- [ ] **IAM User Audit** (`iam_user_audit.py`)  
  - [ ] List all IAM users and their assigned policies.  
  - [ ] Detect users with excessive permissions.

- [ ] **Inactive IAM User Cleanup** (`cleanup_inactive_users.py`)  
  - [ ] Identify IAM users who haven't logged in for X days.  
  - [ ] Disable or delete inactive accounts.

- [ ] **Security Group Rule Auditor** (`audit_security_groups.py`)  
  - [ ] Check for overly permissive security group rules (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0` on SSH).  
  - [ ] Generate a security report.

- [ ] **AWS Config Compliance Checker** (`config_compliance_check.py`)  
  - [ ] Query AWS Config for non-compliant resources.  
  - [ ] Generate a report of security violations.

---

## Incident Response & Threat Detection
- [ ] **GuardDuty Findings Exporter** (`export_guardduty_findings.py`)  
  - [ ] Retrieve GuardDuty findings and export them for analysis.

- [ ] **CloudTrail Anomaly Detector** (`cloudtrail_anomaly_detector.py`)  
  - [ ] Scan CloudTrail logs for unusual activity (e.g., API calls from unknown IPs).  

- [ ] **Auto-Block Suspicious IPs** (`block_suspicious_ips.py`)  
  - [ ] Detect unauthorized access attempts in AWS logs.  
  - [ ] Automatically add offending IPs to a Network ACL or security group block list.

---

## AWS Resource Management
- [ ] **S3 Bucket Encryption Enforcer** (`enforce_s3_encryption.py`)  
  - [ ] Check all S3 buckets for encryption settings.  
  - [ ] Apply default encryption if missing.

- [ ] **EC2 Instance Compliance Scanner** (`ec2_compliance_scan.py`)  
  - [ ] Scan EC2 instances for security misconfigurations (e.g., public IPs, outdated AMIs).  
  - [ ] Generate a compliance report.

- [ ] **Automatic EBS Volume Backup** (`ebs_backup.py`)  
  - [ ] Create snapshots of all active EBS volumes for disaster recovery.  

---

## Networking & Firewall Management
- [ ] **Security Group Rule Reporter** (`list_security_groups.py`)  
  - [ ] List all security groups and their inbound/outbound rules.

- [ ] **Automated Firewall Rule Updater** (`update_firewall_rules.py`)  
  - [ ] Add or remove security group rules based on predefined security policies.

- [ ] **VPC Flow Logs Analyzer** (`analyze_vpc_flow_logs.py`)  
  - [ ] Parse VPC Flow Logs and highlight suspicious or unexpected traffic.

---

## AWS CLI & Boto3 Utilities
- [ ] **Bulk Tag AWS Resources** (`bulk_tag_resources.py`)  
  - [ ] Add tags to all AWS resources in an account.

- [ ] **AWS Cost Analyzer** (`cost_analyzer.py`)  
  - [ ] Fetch AWS cost and usage reports for billing analysis.

- [ ] **Lambda Deployment Helper** (`deploy_lambda.py`)  
  - [ ] Automate AWS Lambda function packaging and deployment.

---

## Next Steps
- Organize these scripts into relevant subfolders (`security/`, `networking/`, `management/`).
- Use Python (`Boto3`) for AWS automation and Shell scripts for CLI-based tasks.
- Test each script in a **sandbox AWS account** before using it in production.
