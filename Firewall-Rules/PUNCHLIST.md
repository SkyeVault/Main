# Firewall Rules Punchlist

## Overview

This punchlist covers a range of tasks and projects focused on firewall rule configuration and management in AWS and hybrid environments. These items include setting up AWS WAF, configuring security groups and network ACLs, deploying third-party firewall solutions, developing hybrid cloud policies, and auditing existing rules. Completing these tasks will improve your ability to secure network perimeters and manage traffic effectively.

## Tasks

- [ ] **AWS WAF Configuration**
  - [ ] Create rules to block common web attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
  - [ ] Test rule effectiveness with simulated attack patterns.
- [ ] **Security Groups & Network ACLs**
  - [ ] Configure security groups as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
  - [ ] Set up network ACLs to control inbound/outbound traffic in your VPC.
- [ ] **Third-Party Firewall Deployment**
  - [ ] Evaluate cloud-based firewall solutions (e.g., Palo Alto, Fortinet) integrated with AWS.
  - [ ] Document configuration steps and performance testing.
- [ ] **Hybrid Cloud Firewall Policies**
  - [ ] Develop firewall rules for environments that span on-premise and AWS.
  - [ ] Test connectivity and security across VPNs or Direct Connect links.
- [ ] **Firewall Rule Auditing and Optimization**
  - [ ] Regularly review firewall rules for relevance and effectiveness.
  - [ ] Optimize rules based on traffic patterns and emerging threat intelligence.
