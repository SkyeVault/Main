  <p>DevLog 250302: The Shift to Rust and Transparent DevOps</p>
  <p>Where We’ve Been</p>
  <p>SkyeVault Ops began as an experiment in AWS security and
  automation, with a focus on understanding cloud security best
  practices and improving workflows through automation. The initial work
  involved scripting and infrastructure setup, but it became clear that
  existing approaches were limiting scalability, security, and
  maintainability.</p>
  <p>Early efforts were focused on: • Setting up AWS security monitoring
  tools • Automating infrastructure with simple scripts • Exploring
  cloud security principles through hands-on projects</p>
  <p>While these efforts provided a solid foundation, they exposed
  fundamental inefficiencies in traditional DevOps approaches. Scripting
  languages like Python and Bash, while useful, lacked the performance,
  memory safety, and reliability needed for long-term scaling.</p>
  <p>This realization led to a decision: SkyeVault Ops needed to
  evolve.</p>
  <p>Where We’re Going</p>
  <p>The next phase of SkyeVault Ops is a full transition to Rust-based
  DevOps and security automation. This shift is not just about changing
  a programming language—it’s about adopting a new way of thinking about
  security, performance, and transparency in development.</p>
  <p>The key areas of focus moving forward:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Rust as the Core of SkyeVault Ops</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Rust provides: • Memory safety without garbage collection, reducing
  security risks. • Concurrency without data races, making automation
  tools more efficient. • Performance at the level of C/C++, ensuring
  that cloud security tools run efficiently.</p>
  <p>Instead of relying on traditional scripting, SkyeVault Ops will be
  built as a modular, high-performance security automation
  framework.</p>
  <ol start="2" type="1">
  <li>Fully Transparent DevOps</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This project will document everything, from design decisions to
  technical challenges. Transparency will be achieved through: •
  Detailed DevLogs outlining progress, roadblocks, and solutions. •
  Clear CI/CD workflows that automate testing, deployments, and security
  checks. • Publicly available tools and resources that contribute to
  open-source security.</p>
  <ol start="3" type="1">
  <li>GitLab as a Potential Home for SkyeVault Ops</li>
  </ol>
  <p>While GitHub has been the primary platform, GitLab offers
  advantages for security-focused DevOps workflows. This transition will
  involve: • Evaluating GitLab CI/CD as an alternative to GitHub
  Actions. • Exploring self-hosting options for full control over
  infrastructure. • Comparing feature sets to determine if GitLab is the
  right fit for the project.</p>
  <p>If GitLab proves to be the better choice, SkyeVault Ops will fully
  migrate. If not, the project will remain on GitHub with select
  integrations from GitLab where needed.</p>
  <p>Next Steps</p>
  <p>The immediate focus is on: 1. Refactoring initial scripts into Rust
  for better performance and reliability. 2. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline
  that supports Rust development and automated security testing. 3.
  Publishing the first Rust-based security tool as part of the SkyeVault
  Ops framework.</p>
  <p>This transition marks a new direction—one that aligns with modern
  security engineering, automation best practices, and DevOps
  transparency.</p>
  <p>Future updates will go deeper into technical implementations,
  challenges, and breakthroughs.</p>
  <p>This is just the beginning.</p>
