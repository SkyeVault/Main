  250312: Setting Up REVM and Foundry in Metaverse Sandbox</h1>
  <h2 id="progress-summary"><strong>Progress Summary</strong></h2>
  <p>Today was a productive day in the <strong>Metaverse
  Sandbox</strong> repo. I successfully set up <strong>REVM</strong> and
  <strong>Foundry</strong>, integrating them into my development
  environment. This brings the project one step closer to a fully
  functional blockchain-backed metaverse.</p>
  <h2 id="accomplishments"><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Installed and configured <strong>REVM</strong> for local Ethereum
  execution<br />
  </li>
  <li>Set up <strong>Foundry</strong> for Solidity contract development
  and testing<br />
  </li>
  <li>Connected to a <strong>faucet</strong> to fund my test
  wallet<br />
  </li>
  <li>Prepared contracts for deployment to <strong>Polygon Mumbai
  Testnet</strong><br />
  </li>
  <li>Debugged initial configurations to ensure compatibility with my
  workflow</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I was about to deploy to <strong>Polygon Mumbai</strong>, but I had
  to stop for the evening. Tomorrowâ€™s goal is to complete the deployment
  and start testing contract interactions.</p>
