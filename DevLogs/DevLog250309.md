### *Debugging Package Failure & Refining Blockchain Project*  

---

## **Overview**  
Today's focus is on **fixing the failing status** in the current package due to the **lib update** and continuing to clean up and refine the **NanoVault project**. Additionally, I’ll be reviewing the **pathway script** and considering a **new project name**, since "NanoVault" is already used by a **Nano blockchain tool**.  

---

## **1. Debugging Package Failure**  

### **Issue:**  
- The package **status is failing** due to the **lib update**.  
- The issue likely stems from **incorrect module structure or missing references**.  
- Plan to **rework the library structure** and check the integration with `docs.rs`.  

### **Next Steps:**  
- **Run `cargo check` and `cargo test`** to pinpoint errors.  
- **Ensure `lib.rs` is correctly structured** and module paths are defined properly.  
- **Update `Cargo.toml` if needed** to reflect the correct library exports.  
- **Push fixes** and verify the package builds successfully.

## **2. NanoVault Project Cleanup**  

### **Tasks Completed:**  
- Cleaned up the **NanoVault project directory** for better organization.  
- Removed unnecessary files and refactored initial scripts.  

### **Pathway Script Review:**  
- Reviewing the **setup and environment configuration** in the **pathway script**.  
- Ensuring smooth installation and setup across different environments.  

### **New Project Name Consideration:**  
- "NanoVault" is already taken by a **Nano blockchain security tool**.  
- Researching **alternative names** that align with the project’s security and blockchain focus.  

---

## **3. Next Steps**  

### **Immediate Focus:**  
- Debug and fix the **failing package status** related to `lib.rs`.  
- Finalize **NanoVault project name change** to avoid conflicts.  
- Refine the **pathway script** to ensure smooth execution.  

### **Future Considerations:**  
- Expand package documentation with **usage examples and API references**.  
- Plan out additional **blockchain security integrations** for the project.  
- Continue structuring projects for **scalability and maintainability**.  

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
The **lib update issue** needs to be resolved to get the package back to a **passing status**. At the same time, **cleaning up the NanoVault project** and selecting a **new name** will help with long-term clarity. Once these are sorted, the focus will shift toward **refining the setup process and expanding project functionality**.  

Will update once debugging progress is made.
