# **SkyeVault Ops - Dev Log | 250304**  
### *Project Restructuring Completed – Debugging `main.rs` in Spotify Playlist Maker*  

---

## **Current Status**  
The **file and folder restructuring is now complete** for Rust projects. The **Spotify Playlist Maker** is now properly organized under `/main/rust_projects/spotify_playlist_maker`, ensuring a clean separation from other projects like **SkyeVault Ops**.  

With the new structure in place, I’m back to debugging `main.rs`, which is throwing several errors. These seem to be a mix of **authentication issues and compilation errors**. Running `cargo watch` to iterate quickly.

## **Work in Progress**  

### **File System Restructuring Completed**  
- Finalized the **Rust project directory structure**:  
  ```
  /main  
   ├── rust_projects
   │   ├── spotify_playlist_maker  
   │   │   ├── src/  
   │   │   ├── docs/  
   │   │   ├── README.md  
   │   │   ├── Cargo.toml  
   │   │   └── .gitignore  
  
  ```  
- Verified that `cargo build` and `cargo run` execute properly from the correct directories.  
- Adjusted **VS Code workspace settings** to reflect the new structure.  

### **Debugging `main.rs` in Spotify Playlist Maker**  
- Encountering **multiple errors** during compilation.  
- Running `cargo watch -x run` to track changes efficiently.  
- Errors appear to be **a mix of authentication failures and Rust syntax issues**.  
- Checking the following areas for fixes:  
  - OAuth authentication process.  
  - Struct definitions in `serde_json`.  
  - Rust syntax and type mismatches in API calls.  
  - Missing or incorrect dependencies.  

---

## **Latest Updates**  

### **[Timestamp] File System Restructure Finalized**  
- All Rust projects are properly isolated.  
- VS Code reflects the correct workspace settings.  
- Initial test builds confirm that `cargo` commands work within the new structure.  

### **[Timestamp] Debugging `main.rs` Compilation Errors**  
- First build attempt after restructuring failed due to **missing dependencies** (resolved by rechecking `Cargo.toml`).  
- Authentication request still returning **401 Unauthorized** – possible issue with token handling.  
- Running manual API tests with `curl` to verify if the problem is Rust-specific.  

---

## **Next Steps**  
- Work through the specific errors in `main.rs`, resolving them one at a time.  
- Validate OAuth token request formatting to ensure API compliance.  
- Debug `serde_json` struct definitions to match the API response format.  
- Continue running `cargo watch` to test fixes in real time.

Now that the folder structure is solid, the focus is entirely on debugging `main.rs` and getting the Spotify API integration working correctly. More updates to follow as errors are fixed.
