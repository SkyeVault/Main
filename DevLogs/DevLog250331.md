# DevLog 250331 — Origin

**Why am I doing it?**  
Because I’m a mom and I want something better.  
This is how I build stability and autonomy.  
31 days of devlogs — March 2025 was not theory. It was execution.

## Origin

I entered this field out of necessity — not curiosity.  
I have limited hours, minimal support, and zero tolerance for wasted time. Most of my work is completed while my baby sleeps on my chest. 

Over the past few months, I’ve self-taught across multiple domains while managing full-time caregiving responsibilities.  
Everything I’ve built exists because I needed it to work, scale, and ship — without external help.
