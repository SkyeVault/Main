# **Dev Log | 250307**  
### *GitHub Directory Restructuring & Project Organization*  

---

## **Overview**  
Today, I’m focusing on restructuring my GitHub repositories to keep **fun projects** separate from **security and DevOps work**. I want my professional work in security to stand out on its own, while my creative projects remain accessible for anyone interested in those. This also makes it easier to manage everything and ensure each project has a clear purpose.  

This reorganization will:  
- Keep projects like **Spotify Playlist Maker**, **Netflix Movie Selector**, and **Arduino Experiments** in a dedicated repository.  
- Separate **Security & DevOps** projects into their own space for professional visibility.  
- Make it easier to maintain, document, and expand projects over time.

## **1. GitHub Repository Restructuring**  

### **Goal:** Organize repositories for better structure and visibility.  
- Created two main repositories:  
  - **Fun Projects:** Holds personal coding projects.  
  - **Security & DevOps:** Keeps infrastructure and cybersecurity tools separate.  
- Moved existing projects into their respective repositories:  
  - **Fun Projects Repo:**  
    - `spotify-playlist-maker`  
    - `netflix-movie-selector`  
    - `arduino-experiments`  
  - **Security & DevOps Repo:**  
    - `aws-security-toolkit`  
    - `cloud-infra-monitoring`  
    - `pentest-scripts`  
- Each project now has an individual `README.md` file with a clear description.

## **2. Updating Repository Structure**  

### **Goal:** Keep everything organized and easy to navigate.  
#### **Updated Directory Layout**  
```
/GitHub  
 ├── fun-projects  
 │   ├── spotify-playlist-maker  
 │   ├── netflix-movie-selector  
 │   ├── arduino-experiments  
 │   └── README.md  
 ├── security-ops  
 │   ├── aws-security-toolkit  
 │   ├── cloud-infra-monitoring  
 │   ├── pentest-scripts  
 │   └── README.md  
 ├── portfolio  
 │   ├── zola-site  
 │   ├── tech-demos  
 │   ├── artwork-showcase  
 │   └── README.md  
```  
- **Fun projects repo**: A space for creative coding projects.  
- **Security & DevOps repo**: A focused repository for professional work.  
- **Portfolio repo**: Will later serve as a showcase for both software and design projects.

## **3. Additional Project Ideas & Enhancements**  

### **Expanding Fun Projects**  
- **Spotify Playlist Maker**: Add a **mood-based playlist generator**.  
- **Netflix Movie Selector**: Experiment with **AI-driven suggestions** based on user input.  
- **Arduino Projects**: Work on a **home automation project** or **sensor-based monitoring**.  

### **Enhancing Security & DevOps Projects**  
- **AWS Security Toolkit**: Build an **automated IAM security policy analyzer**.  
- **Cloud Infra Monitoring**: Add **Prometheus & Grafana dashboards** for real-time metrics.  
- **Pentest Scripts**: Develop a **network reconnaissance automation tool** in Rust.  

---

## **4. Next Steps**  

### **Immediate Actions**  
- Move all projects into their correct repositories.  
- Update `README.md` files for each project with setup instructions.  
- Test all builds to make sure the restructuring didn’t break anything.  

### **Upcoming Tasks**  
- Document the **Spotify Playlist Maker and Netflix Movie Selector** projects with setup guides.  
- Research **AI-driven recommendations** for fun projects.  
- Start planning the **portfolio site** that will bring everything together.

## **Final Thoughts**  
This restructuring will help keep everything clean, organized, and easy to manage. I want my **security and DevOps work to be clearly separate from my creative projects**, while still having everything well-documented and accessible. Once this is finalized, I’ll shift my focus toward **building out the portfolio site** and refining each project.
