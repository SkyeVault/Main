## Project: Web3 Decentralized Metaverse Sandbox

### **Objective**
I am building a full-stack **Web3 decentralized metaverse sandbox**, where users can experience an **NFT gallery for socializing**, buy **virtual land**, and build **custom business spaces**. This project aims to create a **decentralized, user-owned environment** that integrates blockchain, NFT-based land ownership, and immersive 3D interactions.

### **Current Focus**
I am researching the **best way to derive a tech stack** for this project. My focus is on selecting frameworks, blockchain layers, and infrastructure that will allow for **scalability, low-cost transactions, and decentralized hosting**. This research will guide the next steps in development.

### **Core Features to Implement**
1. **NFT Gallery Experience** – Users can visit, explore, and interact with NFTs in a virtual space.
2. **Tokenized Land Ownership** – Virtual land will be represented as NFTs that can be bought, sold, or leased.
3. **Business Space Customization** – Users can build digital shops, studios, and offices.
4. **Web3 Wallet Authentication** – MetaMask and WalletConnect for seamless login.
5. **Decentralized Storage** – Using IPFS or Arweave for NFT assets and metadata.
6. **Social Interactions** – Voice, chat, and live events.

### **Tech Stack Considerations**
#### **Frontend (3D Interface & User Interaction)**
- **Three.js** or **Babylon.js** for browser-based 3D rendering.
- **WebXR** for potential VR expansion.
- **React.js** or **Next.js** for UI components.

#### **Smart Contracts & Blockchain Integration**
- **Ethereum (Layer 2 - Polygon or Arbitrum)** for low-cost transactions.
- **ERC-721/ERC-1155** for NFT-based land and assets.
- **OpenZeppelin Libraries** for contract security.

#### **Backend & Storage**
- **Node.js + Express** or **Rust-based backend** for Web3 interactions.
- **IPFS/Arweave** for decentralized storage.
- **GraphQL or The Graph** for querying blockchain data.

#### **Social & Communication**
- **WebRTC** for voice and video chat.
- **Livepeer** for decentralized streaming.
- **GPT-4 AI NPCs** for interactive experiences.

### **Next Steps**
- Finalize the **core tech stack** based on feasibility and scalability.
- Research **smart contract security best practices** to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Experiment with **Three.js and Web3 wallet integration** for initial prototype.
- Investigate **decentralized hosting options** to avoid reliance on Web2 infrastructure.

### **Challenges to Solve**
- Choosing a blockchain that balances **low fees and decentralization**.
- Ensuring **fast load times and smooth 3D rendering** in browsers.
- Making **NFT land interactions gas-efficient and user-friendly**.

### **Developer Notes**
This log serves as a **technical roadmap** for the project's initial research phase. The next few weeks will be dedicated to **tech stack finalization, contract design, and 3D rendering tests**. More detailed development logs will follow as components come together.


Dev Log - Polygon Testnet Setup Woes

Session Summary
Today was supposed to be about setting up the Polygon Amoy testnet, funding a wallet, and deploying a smart contract. Instead, it turned into a mess of hidden transactions, gas fees eating up more than the value of the tokens, and a constant loop of needing more MATIC (or POL, whatever they’re calling it now) just to move funds around.

# Setting Up and Debugging REVM for Ethereum Smart Contracts

**Author:** Your Name  
**Date:** March 2025  
**Project:** Metaverse Sandbox  

This guide documents the **end-to-end setup, debugging, and deployment of an Ethereum smart contract in REVM** using **Foundry** for contract compilation and **Rust** for execution.

---

## **1. Setting Up Foundry for Smart Contract Compilation**

### **1.1 Install Foundry**
Foundry provides Solidity tooling for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts. Install it using:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
forge --version
```

### **1.2 Navigate to the Smart Contract Directory**
Move to the blockchain project folder:

```sh
cd ~/main/blockchain/metaverse-sandbox/blockchain
```

Initialize Foundry (if not already initialized):

```sh
forge init
```

### **1.3 Compile the Solidity Contracts**
Ensure your Solidity contracts exist in `src/`, then run:

```sh
forge build
```

If compilation fails with missing imports (e.g., OpenZeppelin), install dependencies:

```sh
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

If Foundry does not recognize imports, add a remapping in `remappings.txt`:

```
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```

Run `forge build` again to verify successful compilation.

---

## **2. Extracting Smart Contract Bytecode for REVM**

### **2.1 Locate the Compiled Contract JSON**
After running `forge build`, the compiled JSON file should be inside `out/`. Verify its existence:

```sh
find out/ -name "MetaverseLand.json"
```

If missing, rebuild the contracts:

```sh
forge build
```

### **2.2 Extract the Bytecode**
If the compiled JSON exists at `out/MetaverseLand.sol/MetaverseLand.json`, extract the **deployment bytecode**:

```sh
jq -r '.bytecode.object' out/MetaverseLand.sol/MetaverseLand.json > ../blockchain/bytecode.hex
```

Verify the file:

```sh
ls -l ../blockchain/bytecode.hex
```

Ensure the extracted bytecode does not contain an `0x` prefix. If it does, remove it:

```sh
sed -i '' 's/^0x//' ../blockchain/bytecode.hex
```

---

## **3. Running REVM in Rust**

### **3.1 Navigate to the REVM Rust Project**
Move to the Rust REVM execution directory:

```sh
cd ~/main/blockchain/metaverse-sandbox/backend/revm
```

Ensure `Cargo.toml` exists:

```sh
ls -l Cargo.toml
```

### **3.2 Modify `main.rs` to Load Bytecode**
Open `src/main.rs` and ensure it reads `bytecode.hex` properly:

```rust
let bytecode_str = fs::read_to_string("../../blockchain/bytecode.hex")
    .expect("Failed to load bytecode.hex. Ensure the file exists in ../../blockchain/bytecode.hex");

let cleaned_bytecode = bytecode_str.trim().trim_start_matches("0x");
let bytecode_bytes = hex::decode(cleaned_bytecode).expect("Invalid hex");
```

### **3.3 Simulate Contract Deployment in REVM**
Modify `main.rs` to ensure REVM correctly interprets the bytecode as a contract creation:

```rust
evm.context.evm.inner.env.tx.transact_to = revm::primitives::TransactTo::Create;
let result = evm.transact().expect("Transaction failed");
```

Recompile and run REVM:

```sh
cargo clean
cargo build
cargo run
```

---

## **4. Debugging Common Errors**

### **4.1 File Not Found: `MetaverseLand.json`**
If Foundry cannot locate `MetaverseLand.json`, verify the file's existence:

```sh
find out/ -name "MetaverseLand.json"
```

If missing, recompile:

```sh
forge build
```

---

### **4.2 Bytecode Not Found**
If `bytecode.hex` is missing, regenerate it:

```sh
jq -r '.bytecode.object' out/MetaverseLand.sol/MetaverseLand.json > ../blockchain/bytecode.hex
```

Verify:

```sh
ls -l ../blockchain/bytecode.hex
```

---

### **4.3 Invalid Hex Character Error**
If REVM throws an `InvalidHexCharacter` error, ensure `bytecode.hex` does not contain `0x`:

```sh
sed -i '' 's/^0x//' ../blockchain/bytecode.hex
```

---

### **4.4 REVM Does Not Deploy the Contract**
If REVM executes but returns `0x00` bytecode, ensure you are using **deployment bytecode**, not runtime bytecode:

```sh
jq -r '.bytecode.object' out/MetaverseLand.sol/MetaverseLand.json | head -n 5
jq -r '.deployedBytecode.object' out/MetaverseLand.sol/MetaverseLand.json | head -n 5
```

If `.deployedBytecode.object` contains valid data, use that instead:

```sh
jq -r '.deployedBytecode.object' out/MetaverseLand.sol/MetaverseLand.json > ../blockchain/bytecode.hex
```

---

## **5. Confirming Contract Deployment**
A successful deployment should return an **EVM Execution Result** similar to:

```
EVM Execution Result: Success { reason: Return, gas_used: 53000, gas_refunded: 0, logs: [], output: Create(0x, Some(0xbd770416a3345f91e4b34576cb804a576fa48eb1)) }
```

This confirms that:
- The contract **was created successfully**.
- It was deployed at address: `0xbd770416a3345f91e4b34576cb804a576fa48eb1`.

---

## **6. Conclusion**
By following these steps, you successfully:
- Set up **Foundry** for contract compilation.
- Extracted the correct **bytecode**.
- Configured **REVM** to execute smart contract deployments.
- Debugged **common Rust and REVM errors**.
- Successfully **deployed and interacted with a smart contract** in a simulated Ethereum environment.

This guide serves as a **complete reference for setting up and debugging REVM-based Ethereum development**.

# **Devlog 250313: Alchemy Setup and Polygon Amoy Testnet Challenges**  

## **What Happened**  

- **Alchemy setup was successful.** Connected to the **Polygon Amoy testnet**, verified **RPC settings**, and confirmed everything was working.  
- **Hit the "must have 0.001 POL on Polygon PoS" issue.** The **Amoy faucet** refused to send testnet POL unless the account already held **mainnet POL**, leading to the next challenge.  
- **Tried bridging funds.** Sent **WETH from Coinbase Wallet**, expecting a simple transfer to **MetaMask**, but it turned into a **gas-fee nightmare**.  
- **No way to move WETH without MATIC.** Couldn’t send or swap anything because there wasn’t enough **MATIC to cover gas fees**.  
- **Bought MATIC through MetaMask (via Coinbase Pay).** Expected an **instant transfer**, but it **never appeared** in **MetaMask or Polygonscan**, leading to another dead end.  

---

## **Frustrations & Takeaways**  

- **Spending more on gas fees than the token’s actual worth is infuriating.** A **$2 transaction** quickly turns into a **$5 problem**.  
- **Bridging and swapping funds feels unnecessarily complex.** The **gas-to-move-gas** dependency is frustrating, forcing users to spend more just to get started.  
- **Testnets requiring mainnet tokens defeats the purpose.** The goal is to **experiment**, yet the system forces users to **hold real assets first**.  
- **Still no idea where the MATIC from MetaMask’s Coinbase integration went.** It’s **not in MetaMask**, **not on Polygonscan**, and there’s no clear way to **track it down**.  

---

## **Next Steps**  

1. **Investigate the missing MATIC purchase.** If it **never processed**, look into an alternative method for acquiring **testnet funds**.  
2. **If MATIC arrives, use just enough for gas fees** to move the **WETH to MetaMask**.  
3. **Once gas fees are covered, swap WETH for MATIC or POL** (whichever is needed to proceed).  
4. **Resume the main goal: deploying the contract on Amoy** without running out of funds.  

### **Biggest Issue Right Now**  
Having **assets trapped with no way to move them** is a serious usability problem. This experience highlights why people get frustrated with **crypto onboarding**. If the **next session** happens, the primary goal will be securing even the **smallest amount of working funds** on **Polygon PoS** and **finally deploying the contract**.
