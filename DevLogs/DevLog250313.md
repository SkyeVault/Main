## Project: Web3 Decentralized Metaverse Sandbox

### **Objective**
I am building a full-stack **Web3 decentralized metaverse sandbox**, where users can experience an **NFT gallery for socializing**, buy **virtual land**, and build **custom business spaces**. This project aims to create a **decentralized, user-owned environment** that integrates blockchain, NFT-based land ownership, and immersive 3D interactions.

### **Current Focus**
I am researching the **best way to derive a tech stack** for this project. My focus is on selecting frameworks, blockchain layers, and infrastructure that will allow for **scalability, low-cost transactions, and decentralized hosting**. This research will guide the next steps in development.

### **Core Features to Implement**
1. **NFT Gallery Experience** – Users can visit, explore, and interact with NFTs in a virtual space.
2. **Tokenized Land Ownership** – Virtual land will be represented as NFTs that can be bought, sold, or leased.
3. **Business Space Customization** – Users can build digital shops, studios, and offices.
4. **Web3 Wallet Authentication** – MetaMask and WalletConnect for seamless login.
5. **Decentralized Storage** – Using IPFS or Arweave for NFT assets and metadata.
6. **Social Interactions** – Voice, chat, and live events.

### **Tech Stack Considerations**
#### **Frontend (3D Interface & User Interaction)**
- **Three.js** or **Babylon.js** for browser-based 3D rendering.
- **WebXR** for potential VR expansion.
- **React.js** or **Next.js** for UI components.

#### **Smart Contracts & Blockchain Integration**
- **Ethereum (Layer 2 - Polygon or Arbitrum)** for low-cost transactions.
- **ERC-721/ERC-1155** for NFT-based land and assets.
- **OpenZeppelin Libraries** for contract security.

#### **Backend & Storage**
- **Node.js + Express** or **Rust-based backend** for Web3 interactions.
- **IPFS/Arweave** for decentralized storage.
- **GraphQL or The Graph** for querying blockchain data.

#### **Social & Communication**
- **WebRTC** for voice and video chat.
- **Livepeer** for decentralized streaming.
- **GPT-4 AI NPCs** for interactive experiences.

### **Next Steps**
- Finalize the **core tech stack** based on feasibility and scalability.
- Research **smart contract security best practices** to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Experiment with **Three.js and Web3 wallet integration** for initial prototype.
- Investigate **decentralized hosting options** to avoid reliance on Web2 infrastructure.

### **Challenges to Solve**
- Choosing a blockchain that balances **low fees and decentralization**.
- Ensuring **fast load times and smooth 3D rendering** in browsers.
- Making **NFT land interactions gas-efficient and user-friendly**.

### **Developer Notes**
This log serves as a **technical roadmap** for the project's initial research phase. The next few weeks will be dedicated to **tech stack finalization, contract design, and 3D rendering tests**. More detailed development logs will follow as components come together.


Dev Log - Polygon Testnet Setup Woes

Session Summary
Today was supposed to be about setting up the Polygon Amoy testnet, funding a wallet, and deploying a smart contract. Instead, it turned into a mess of hidden transactions, gas fees eating up more than the value of the tokens, and a constant loop of needing more MATIC (or POL, whatever they’re calling it now) just to move funds around.

What Happened
Alchemy setup went smoothly. Connected to the Polygon Amoy testnet, verified RPC settings, and everything checked out.
Ran into the “must have 0.001 POL on Polygon PoS” issue. The Amoy faucet wouldn’t send testnet POL without first holding mainnet POL, which led to the next issue.
Tried bridging funds. Sent WETH from Coinbase Wallet, thinking it would be an easy transfer to MetaMask, but it turned into a gas-fee nightmare.
No way to move WETH without MATIC. Couldn’t send or swap anything because there wasn’t enough MATIC to cover the gas.
Bought MATIC through MetaMask (via Coinbase Pay). Expected an instant transfer, but it didn’t show up in MetaMask or on Polygonscan, leading to another dead end.
Frustrations & Takeaways
Spending more on gas fees than the token’s actual worth is infuriating. A $2 transaction turns into a $5 problem.
Bridging and swapping funds feels unnecessarily complex. You need gas to move gas, which creates a circular dependency that’s impossible to break without spending more money.
Testnets shouldn’t require mainnet tokens. If the goal is to experiment, forcing users to hold real assets first completely defeats the purpose.
Still no idea where the MATIC from MetaMask’s Coinbase integration went. It’s not showing up, not visible on Polygonscan, and there’s no clear way to track it down.
Next Steps
Figure out what happened to the MATIC purchase. If it never went through, consider using another method to get testnet funds.
If the MATIC arrives, swap just enough for gas fees and then move the WETH to MetaMask.
Once gas fees are covered, swap WETH for MATIC (or POL, whatever’s required to keep going).
Finally, get back to the actual goal: deploying the contract on Amoy without running out of funds.
Right now, the biggest issue is having assets trapped with no way to move them. That alone is enough to drive someone away from crypto entirely. If there's a next session, the goal will be getting even the smallest amount of working funds on Polygon PoS and finally testing the contract.
