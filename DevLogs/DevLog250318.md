# Devlog 250318: Untangling Wallets & Preparing for NFT Deployment

## **Overview**  
Today's focus is on **organizing my crypto wallets, securing testnet funds, and preparing for NFT deployment**. I need to resolve issues related to **multiple wallet profiles**, get **Alchemy Faucet to recognize my balance**, and **fully understand the NFT minting process** before committing to the next steps in my metaverse project.

---

## **Current Challenges**  
### **1. Wallet Consolidation**  
- I apparently have **four different wallet profiles**, which is causing confusion.
- There is a **connection between Coinbase and MetaMask**, but I can't see my Coinbase funds in the "Coinbase" MetaMask profile.
- I need to **merge or consolidate** these wallets for a streamlined development workflow.

### **2. Testnet Funding Issues**  
- I **deployed a test smart contract**, so I understand gas fees and the process, but I can't **start converting my digital gallery into NFTs** until I have a solid understanding of contract creation.
- **Alchemy Faucet does not recognize my MATIC or Wrapped Ether balance**—I need to troubleshoot why.
- I will be using **Polygon (formerly MATIC)** as my test environment.
- I need **testnet MATIC/WETH** to proceed with storage and smart contract testing.

### **3. NFT Storage & Web3 UI Hosting**  
- My NFTs will be stored on **NFT.Storage**.
- My entire website and UI will be hosted via **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**.
- Need to **set up a basic landing page** to start testing wallet interactions and NFT updates.

### **4. Web3 Browser Setup**  
- I need to **install and configure a Web3 browser extension** to interact with my smart contracts seamlessly.

## **Next Steps**  
1. **Resolve wallet inconsistencies** by reviewing MetaMask and Coinbase account settings.
2. **Confirm testnet MATIC/WETH balances** and resolve issues with Alchemy Faucet.
3. **Deploy a very basic Next.js landing page** to test Web3 interactions.
4. **Ensure my Web3 extension is properly installed and linked to my primary wallet.**
5. **Prepare and register digital assets on NFT.Storage** once my testnet funding is sorted.
6. **Set clear intentions before diving deeper** into NFT deployment and smart contract refinement.

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
This is an important project, and I need to **carefully structure my workflow** to fit into the time I have while balancing other responsibilities.

 **Mission: Get testnet funding in order.** Without that, I can’t proceed with registering NFTs or refining my contract deployment.

 **Meta Reminder:** Crypto is intricate—setting clear goals before diving in is essential.

 **If you’re reading this, send snacks and MATIC!**

# Crypto Wallet & Testnet MATIC Issue Log  

## Summary of What We Discovered  

### 1. Not Enough Gas to Transfer MATIC  
- I have **$0.xx of MATIC** in my **Coinbase Exchange** account.  
- This **is not enough** to cover the **gas fee** needed to withdraw it to **MetaMask**.  

### 2. Why I Need MATIC in MetaMask  
- I was trying to use **Alchemy Faucets** to get **testnet MATIC** for smart contract testing.  
- However, to **claim testnet MATIC**, I need **real MATIC** in MetaMask to interact with the faucet.  

### 3. Next Steps  
1. **Buy more MATIC** to cover gas fees.  
2. **Transfer MATIC to MetaMask** (Polygon Network).  
3. **Use Alchemy Faucet** to claim testnet MATIC.  
4. **Start smart contract testing on Mumbai Testnet**.  

once this is figured out, I can mint my own NFT collection and build the metaverse gallery.
