# **SkyeVault Ops - Dev Log | 250305**  
### *Taking a Break to Reflect on Future Projects*  

---

## **Current Status**  
Today, I’m stepping away from the computer for a bit while traveling to Philadelphia. Taking this time to reflect on the **Spotify Playlist Maker** and consider the next phase of development. The core functionality is now working, but there's **potential for expanding the concept further**.  

---

## **Project Ideas & Considerations**  

### **1. Enhancing the Spotify Playlist Maker**  
- Should I develop a **UI for better usability**?  
- Could I integrate **auto-suggestions** based on:  
  - **Mood-based playlists** (e.g., relaxing, focus, energy)?  
  - **Artists and genre preferences**?  
  - **Keywords typed in by the user**?  
- Would adding **machine learning elements** to analyze user history improve recommendations?  

### **2. Netflix Movie Recommendation Tool**  
- A tool that suggests **movies or shows** based on:  
  - **Mood or genre preferences**.  
  - **A few simple questions** to personalize recommendations.  
  - **Keyword-based searches** (e.g., “sci-fi adventure with great cinematography”).  
- Could use **web scraping and AI** to refine suggestions fron Netflix current library.  
- This could be a good introduction to **Rust, API integration, web scraping, and AI** in a single project.  

---

## **Reflections & Next Steps**  
- The **Spotify Playlist Maker** is now functional, but **a UI and better recommendations could make it much more powerful**.  
- A **Netflix recommendation tool** would be an interesting way to start exploring **AI-driven suggestions**.  
- The **combination of Rust, APIs, web scraping, and AI opens up endless possibilities**—figuring out how to focus efforts effectively.  

---

### **Immediate Next Steps**  
- Reflect on whether the **Spotify UI and auto-suggestion features** should be the next priority.  
- Consider whether the **Netflix recommendation tool** is worth prototyping.  
- Research **how Rust handles AI and recommendation engines** to evaluate feasibility.

The focus today is on **big-picture planning**, allowing space for creative exploration before jumping back into coding. Will reassess priorities after returning from travel.
