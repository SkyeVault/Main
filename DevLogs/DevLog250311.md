# DevLog 250310

## Progress Update

Today, I successfully created the **Metaverse Sandbox** repository and structured the framework for the project. The foundational elements are in place, including:

- **Project structure setup** with Foundry for smart contract development.
- **Initial instructions and documentation** for onboarding contributors.
- **Integration planning** for decentralized land ownership and marketplace functions.

The repository is now organized and primed for the next stage of development.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow, I will begin **testing the project**, focusing on:

- Running **initial contract deployments** with Foundry.
- **Verifying smart contract logic** and expected behaviors.
- Ensuring **proper integrations** between the backend and blockchain layers.
- Addressing any **early issues** before progressing further.

This marks a strong starting point for the Metaverse Sandbox, and I'm looking forward to refining and expanding its capabilities through testing. More updates to follow soon.
