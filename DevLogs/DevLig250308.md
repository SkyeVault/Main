## Creating My Developer Toolkit in Bash

Today, I'm building a **custom developer toolkit** using **Bash scripting** and saving it in my `notes/terminal` folder. This toolkit will streamline my workflow by automating repetitive tasks like:
- **Syncing with GitHub** (pulling and pushing changes)
- **Updating system software** (ensuring everything is up to date)
- **Checking security settings** (firewall and other protections)
- **Opening essential applications** (Chrome, VS Code, and Finder)

---

## **Setting Up the Developer Toolkit**

### **1. Organizing My Files**
I'm storing my scripts in `~/notes/terminal/dev_toolkit.sh` so that I can easily access and modify them.

### **2. Automating My Workflow**
I've structured my Bash script to include:
- A **menu-driven interface** for easy selection.
- Functions for **system maintenance, Git operations, and opening tools**.
- **Error handling** to prevent failures from affecting the workflow.

### **3. Key Features in My Toolkit**
#### **Git Sync**
Automatically pulls the latest updates, stages changes, commits with a custom message, and pushes to GitHub.
```bash
./dev_toolkit.sh  # Select Git Sync option
```
#### **System Maintenance**
- Pulls updates from GitHub.
- Downloads and installs macOS system updates.
- Ensures the firewall is enabled and security settings are in place.
```bash
./dev_toolkit.sh  # Select System Maintenance option
```
#### **Morning Setup**
- Opens **Google Chrome** with GitHub.
- Launches **VS Code** for development.
- Opens **Finder** in my main directory.
```bash
./dev_toolkit.sh  # Select Morning Setup option
```

## **Next Steps**
- **Refine the script** with additional security checks.
- **Test it across multiple sessions** to ensure reliability.
- **Expand automation** to include Rust project setup and AWS integrations.

By continuously improving this toolkit, Iâ€™ll optimize my **developer workflow** and make daily tasks more efficient.
