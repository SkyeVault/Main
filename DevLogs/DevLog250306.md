# **Dev Log | 250306**  
### *Building a Unified Portfolio for Graphic Arts & Software Development*  

---

## **Overview**  
Today's focus is on structuring a **comprehensive portfolio** that integrates **graphic arts and software development** projects. This includes organizing GitHub repositories, debugging CI/CD pipelines, exploring **Zola** for static site generation, and researching backend frameworks.  

---

## **1. Syncing GitHub Repositories**  

### **Goal:** Ensure all local files are updated and properly versioned in GitHub.  
- Navigated to project folder:  
  ```sh
  cd path/to/your/project  
  ```  
- Pulled the latest changes to ensure local and remote branches are in sync:  
  ```sh
  git pull origin main  
  ```  
  *(Replace `main` with the correct branch name if needed.)*  
- Checked for any merge conflicts and resolved them as needed.  

---

## **2. Debugging Tests and Fixing Issues**  

### **Goal:** Ensure all unit tests and integration tests pass.  
- Ran all tests:  
  ```sh
  cargo test  
  ```  
- Identified failed tests, reviewed error messages, and applied necessary fixes.  
- Re-ran tests to confirm fixes were successful.  

---

## **3. Ensuring CI/CD Pipeline Works on GitHub**  

### **Goal:** Verify automated testing and deployment processes function correctly.  
- Pushed the latest working changes to GitHub:  
  ```sh
  git add .  
  git commit -m "Fix tests and update project"  
  git push origin main  
  ```  
- Checked **GitHub Actions workflow** for errors:  
  - Navigated to **GitHub → Repository → Actions**  
  - Reviewed logs for failed jobs and debugged as necessary.  
- After resolving any CI/CD issues, re-ran tests and ensured pipeline success.

## **4. Exploring Zola for Portfolio Development**  

### **Goal:** Experiment with **Zola**, a Rust-powered static site generator.  
- Installed Zola:  
  ```sh
  cargo install zola  
  ```  
- Created a test site:  
  ```sh
  zola init my-portfolio  
  cd my-portfolio  
  ```  
- Ran the development server to preview site structure:  
  ```sh
  zola serve  
  ```  
- Opened `http://127.0.0.1:1111` in the browser to test layouts, themes, and content rendering.  

---

## **5. Researching Backend Frameworks for Portfolio**  

### **Goal:** Determine whether a backend is needed for dynamic content.  
- Compared Rust frameworks:  
  - **Axum** (Lightweight, async-friendly, integrates well with frontend frameworks).  
  - **Rocket** (Batteries-included, simple API structure, but slower compile times).  
  - **Actix** (High-performance, but requires a deeper learning curve).  
- Considered database options:  
  - **SurrealDB** (Flexible, Rust-native database).  
  - **PostgreSQL** (Reliable, well-supported relational database).  
- Researched **Cloudflare Workers** as a potential free hosting and API solution.  

---

## **6. Choosing a Hosting Option & Deploying Portfolio**  

### **Goal:** Get a working version of the portfolio online.  
- Evaluated **GitHub Pages**, **Cloudflare Pages**, and **AWS Free Tier** as potential hosting options.  
- Planned deployment steps:  
  - Set up **Zola-based static site** with gallery for artwork and project showcases.  
  - Integrated links to **GitHub repositories** and development logs.  
  - Added functionality for **software demos and documentation**.  
- Next step: Deploy a basic version and gather feedback for improvements.  

---

## **Final Goal: A Unified, Live Portfolio**  
This roadmap ensures that:  
✅ The **Spotify Playlist Maker** project and **CI/CD pipeline** are stable.  
✅ A **Zola-based portfolio** is tested and configured.  
✅ Backend options for dynamic content are explored.  
✅ A **live portfolio** will soon showcase both **art and software projects**.  

---

## **Next Steps**  
- Finalize **Zola structure** and theme selection.  
- Choose hosting provider and set up deployment workflow.  
- Expand portfolio content with **artwork, projects, and Rust-based tools**.  

The focus now is on **bringing everything together into a single, polished portfolio** that reflects both technical and creative work.
